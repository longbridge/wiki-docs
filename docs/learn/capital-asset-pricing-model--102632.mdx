<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return on assets, particularly stocks. It is a financial model that establishes a linear relationship between the required return on an investment and its risk. CAPM is based on the relationship between an asset's beta coefficient, the risk-free rate (usually the yield on government bonds), and the equity risk premium (i.e., the market's expected return minus the risk-free rate).</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> CAPM was independently developed by William Sharpe, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin in the 1960s. Sharpe's 1964 paper, "Capital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium under Conditions of Risk," is considered foundational to CAPM. The model was introduced to better understand and measure systematic risk in investments.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> CAPM has several key characteristics:<ul><li><strong>Beta Coefficient:</strong> Measures the volatility of an individual asset relative to the overall market. A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.</li><li><strong>Risk-Free Rate:</strong> Typically represented by the yield on government bonds, as these are considered risk-free investments.</li><li><strong>Equity Risk Premium:</strong> The market's expected return minus the risk-free rate, reflecting the compensation investors require for taking on additional market risk.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose a stock has a beta coefficient of 1.2, a risk-free rate of 2%, and a market expected return of 8%. According to the CAPM formula, the expected return = 2% + 1.2*(8%-2%) = 9.2%. This means investors expect a 9.2% return from this stock.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> An investment portfolio has a beta coefficient of 0.8, a risk-free rate of 3%, and a market expected return of 10%. According to the CAPM formula, the expected return = 3% + 0.8*(10%-3%) = 8.6%. This indicates that investors expect an 8.6% return from this portfolio.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Issues:</strong><ul><li><strong>CAPM assumes that markets are fully efficient, which is not always the case in reality.</strong> Markets may have information asymmetry and other non-systematic risks.</li><li><strong>CAPM assumes that investors only care about expected return and risk.</strong> In reality, investors may also consider other factors such as liquidity and investment horizon.</li></ul></p>`} id={102632} />
