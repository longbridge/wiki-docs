Gross interest is the annual rate of interest to be paid on an investment, security, or deposit account before taxes or other charges are deducted. Gross interest is often the headline interest rate attached to a fixed-income security (e.g., a bond or CD), a loan, or a deposit account.Gross interest is expressed as a percentage and can be contrasted with net interest, which is the rate of interest earned after taxes, fees, and other costs are deducted. As a result, gross interest will always be higher than net interest.
