The term limited common element refers to an aspect of a condominium unit or complex that is considered to be the property of the community or homeowners association (HOA) rather than that of the tenant. Limited common elements may be found within or outside individual condo units. Although they are deemed common, their use is limited to the occupant of the unit. Examples include balconies, (shared) outdoor space such as patios and terraces, and parking lots and garages.
