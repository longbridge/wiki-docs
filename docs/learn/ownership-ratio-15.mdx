<p>Ownership ratio refers to the ratio between the owner's equity and the total assets of a company, which can also be understood as the proportion of financing by the company through its own funds (owner's equity). This ratio can reflect the company's solvency and risk-bearing capacity. A high ownership ratio means that the company uses less borrowing and relies more on its own funds, which may reduce the company's debt risk.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The equity ratio is the ratio between a company's owner's equity and its total assets, also understood as the proportion of financing through own funds (owner's equity). This ratio reflects a company's debt repayment ability and risk tolerance. A high equity ratio indicates that a company uses less borrowing and relies more on its own funds, potentially reducing its debt repayment risk.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of the equity ratio originates from basic financial analysis principles aimed at assessing a company's financial structure and stability. With the development of modern corporate financial management, the equity ratio has become a key indicator for measuring a company's capital structure.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>The equity ratio is mainly categorized into high and low equity ratios. A high equity ratio indicates that a company primarily relies on its own funds, which lowers risk but may limit expansion capabilities. A low equity ratio means the company relies more on external borrowing, which can bring higher financial risk but also potentially faster growth.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: Apple Inc. has maintained a high equity ratio throughout its development, which has allowed it to maintain strong financial stability amid market fluctuations. Case 2: Tesla, in its early development stages, adopted a low equity ratio, using significant borrowing to achieve rapid expansion, but also faced higher financial risks.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand that a high equity ratio means a lack of growth potential, but this depends on the company's strategy and market environment. Additionally, while a low equity ratio may offer high returns, it also comes with higher risks.</p>`} id={15} />
