<p>Ownership ratio refers to the ratio between the owner's equity and the total assets of a company, which can also be understood as the proportion of financing by the company through its own funds (owner's equity). This ratio can reflect the company's solvency and risk-bearing capacity. A high ownership ratio means that the company uses less borrowing and relies more on its own funds, which may reduce the company's debt risk.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The equity ratio is the ratio between a company's owner's equity and its total assets. It can also be understood as the proportion of financing through self-owned funds (owner's equity). This ratio reflects the company's debt repayment ability and risk tolerance. A high equity ratio means the company uses less borrowing and relies more on self-owned funds, which may reduce the company's debt repayment risk.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the equity ratio originated in the field of financial analysis and was first proposed in the early 20th century to assess a company's financial health. With the development of modern corporate financial management theory, the equity ratio has gradually become an important indicator for measuring a company's capital structure and risk management.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The equity ratio is mainly divided into high equity ratio and low equity ratio. A high equity ratio (e.g., above 70%) indicates that the company mainly relies on self-owned funds for operations, has less debt, and has lower financial risk; a low equity ratio (e.g., below 30%) indicates that the company relies heavily on borrowing and may face higher financial risk. Companies with a high equity ratio usually have strong debt repayment ability but may face funding shortages when expanding their business; companies with a low equity ratio may face greater debt repayment pressure during economic downturns.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: A manufacturing company A has total assets of 10 million yuan and owner's equity of 7 million yuan, resulting in an equity ratio of 70%. This indicates that the company mainly relies on self-owned funds for operations and has low financial risk.</li><li>Case 2: A technology company B has total assets of 50 million yuan and owner's equity of 15 million yuan, resulting in an equity ratio of 30%. This indicates that the company relies heavily on borrowing for operations and may face higher financial risk.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Question 1: Is a higher equity ratio always better?<br/>Answer: Not necessarily. While a high equity ratio means lower financial risk, it may also limit the company's ability to expand.</li><li>Question 2: How can a company increase its equity ratio?<br/>Answer: A company can increase its equity ratio by increasing owner's equity (e.g., through additional capital contributions) or reducing total assets (e.g., by selling non-core assets).</li></ul></p>`} id={15} />
