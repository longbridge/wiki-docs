A day trader is a type of trader who executes a relatively large volume of short and long trades to capitalize on intraday market price action. The goal is to profit from very short-term price movements. Day traders can also use leverage to amplify returns, which can also amplify losses.While many strategies are employed by day traders, the price action sought after is a result of temporary supply and demand inefficiencies caused due to purchases and sales of the asset. Typically positions are held from periods of milliseconds to hours and are generally closed out before the end of the day so that no risk is held after hours or overnight.
