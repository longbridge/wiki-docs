The current ratio refers to the ratio of current assets to current liabilities of a company. This ratio can be used to evaluate a company's short-term solvency and liquidity.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The current ratio is the ratio of a company's current assets to its current liabilities. This ratio is used to assess a company's short-term debt-paying ability and liquidity. The formula for calculating the current ratio is:</p><p><code>Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities</code></p><p>Current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory, while current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term loans, etc.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the current ratio originated in the early 20th century and was gradually refined with the development of modern corporate financial management theory. The earliest financial ratio analysis can be traced back to the late 19th century, but the current ratio as a standard financial indicator was widely accepted and used in the 1920s.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The current ratio mainly has the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Current Ratio:</strong> This is the most commonly used current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.</li><li><strong>Quick Ratio:</strong> Also known as the acid-test ratio, it is calculated as (current assets - inventory) divided by current liabilities. The quick ratio more strictly assesses a company's short-term debt-paying ability by excluding less liquid inventory.</li></ul><p>Characteristics of the current ratio include:</p><ul><li>Reflects a company's short-term debt-paying ability.</li><li>Helps investors and creditors assess a company's financial health.</li><li>A higher current ratio usually indicates a stronger short-term debt-paying ability, but an excessively high ratio may imply inefficient asset utilization.</li></ul><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong></p><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company has current assets of 1 million yuan and current liabilities of 500,000 yuan, so its current ratio is:</p><p><code>Current Ratio = 1,000,000 / 500,000 = 2</code></p><p>This means that the company has 2 yuan of current assets for every 1 yuan of current liabilities, indicating strong short-term debt-paying ability.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company has current assets of 2 million yuan but current liabilities of 1.8 million yuan, so its current ratio is:</p><p><code>Current Ratio = 2,000,000 / 1,800,000 â‰ˆ 1.11</code></p><p>This indicates that the company has only 1.11 yuan of current assets for every 1 yuan of current liabilities, indicating weak short-term debt-paying ability.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>What is a reasonable current ratio?</strong> Generally, a current ratio between 1.5 and 2 is considered reasonable, but the specific situation should be analyzed in conjunction with industry characteristics and the company's actual situation.</li><li><strong>What are the problems with a current ratio that is too high or too low?</strong> An excessively high current ratio may imply inefficient asset utilization, while a low current ratio may indicate insufficient short-term debt-paying ability and financial risk.</li></ul>`} id={181} />
