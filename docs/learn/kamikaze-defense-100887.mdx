A Kamikaze defense is a defensive strategy sometimes resorted to by a company's management to prevent a takeover by another company.While these strategies are named after the suicidal kamikaze attacks used by Japanese pilots during World War II, they rarely destroy the company. Nevertheless, a kamikaze defense involves taking measures that are detrimental to the firm's business operations or financial condition. The idea is to reduce the target companyâ€™s attractiveness to a hostile bidder. A kamikaze defense is desperate, but the hope is that the takeover bid will be thwarted.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Kamikaze defense is a defensive strategy employed by a company's management to prevent a takeover by another company. Although these strategies are named after the suicidal kamikaze attacks used by Japanese pilots during World War II, they rarely destroy the company.
