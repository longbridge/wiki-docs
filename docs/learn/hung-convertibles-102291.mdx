<p>Outstanding Convertible Bonds refer to convertible bonds that have not yet been converted into company stock or reached maturity for repayment. Convertible bonds are hybrid securities that give holders the option to convert the bonds into company shares under specified conditions. Outstanding convertible bonds represent those still circulating in the market, which have not been converted into stock by the holders nor redeemed or repaid by the company. Managing outstanding convertible bonds is crucial for a company's financial planning and investor relations, as they can potentially impact the company's equity structure and debt levels.</p>
