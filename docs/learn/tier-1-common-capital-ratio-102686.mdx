<p>Tier 1 common capital ratio is a measurement of a bank's core equity capital, compared with its total risk-weighted assets, and signifies a bank's financial strength. The Tier 1 common capital ratio is utilized by regulators and investors because it shows how well a bank can withstand financial stress and remain solvent. Tier 1 common capital excludes any preferred shares or non-controlling interests, which makes it differ from the closely-related tier 1 capital ratio.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio is the ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets. Core equity capital primarily includes common stock and retained earnings, representing the bank's financial strength. Regulators and investors use the CET1 ratio to assess a bank's ability to maintain solvency under financial stress. The CET1 ratio excludes any preferred stock or non-controlling interests, differentiating it from similar Tier 1 capital ratios.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the CET1 ratio originates from the Basel Accords, particularly Basel III. The Basel Accords are international banking regulatory frameworks developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Basel III was introduced after the 2009 financial crisis to improve the quality of bank capital and liquidity levels, enhancing the stability of the global financial system.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The CET1 ratio mainly includes the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Common Stock:</strong> Includes common shares issued by the bank and related capital reserves.</li><li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> Profits retained by the bank after dividends are paid.</li></ul>These capital items share the characteristic of having high loss-absorbing capacity, providing a buffer during financial distress.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A bank has total common stock and retained earnings of 10 billion RMB and total risk-weighted assets of 50 billion RMB, resulting in a CET1 ratio of 20% (10 billion / 50 billion). This indicates that the bank has sufficient core capital to cover potential risks.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> During the 2008 financial crisis, many banks saw their CET1 ratios plummet, necessitating government bailouts. Subsequently, global regulators strengthened capital adequacy requirements, mandating higher CET1 ratios to enhance banks' risk resilience.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why is the CET1 ratio so important?</strong> The CET1 ratio is a crucial indicator of a bank's financial health. A higher ratio means the bank has a stronger capacity to absorb losses and maintain operations.</li><li><strong>How can a bank improve its CET1 ratio?</strong> Banks can improve their CET1 ratio by issuing more common stock, increasing profitability, or reducing risk-weighted assets.</li></ul></p>`} id={102686} />
