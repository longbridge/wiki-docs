The net amount is the amount paid when purchasing these equity investments minus the amount obtained from selling or liquidating these equity investments. The net amount of long-term equity investment reflects the value of the equity investment held by the enterprise in other enterprises.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of long-term equity investment originated from corporate financial management and accounting.

The characteristic of controlling investments is that the enterprise can reflect its financial status through consolidated financial statements, while non-controlling investments are usually accounted for using the equity method.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. <em>Case One:</em> Company A purchased a 30% equity stake in Company B for 5 million yuan in 2020. In 2023, Company A decided to sell its equity stake in Company B and received 6 million yuan. The net amount of long-term equity investment is 6 million yuan minus 5 million yuan, which is 1 million yuan. 2. <em>Case Two:</em> Company C purchased a 60% equity stake in Company D for 10 million yuan in 2018. In 2024, Company C decided to liquidate its equity stake in Company D and received 12 million yuan. The net amount of long-term equity investment is 12 million yuan minus 10 million yuan, which is 2 million yuan.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <em>What is the difference between the net amount of long-term equity investment and short-term equity investment?</em> The net amount of long-term equity investment refers to equity investments held for more than one year, while short-term equity investments are usually held for less than one year. 2. <em>How to calculate the net amount of long-term equity investment?</em> The formula for calculating the net amount of long-term equity investment is: Net amount of long-term equity investment = Amount obtained from selling or liquidating equity investment - Amount paid for purchasing equity investment.</p>`} id={282} />
