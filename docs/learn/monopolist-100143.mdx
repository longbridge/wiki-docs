A monopolist is an individual, group, or company that controls all of the market for a particular good or service.Â A monopolist probably also believes in policies that favor monopolies since it gives them greater power. A monopolist has little incentive to improve their product because customers have no alternatives. Instead, their motivation is focused on protecting the monopoly.
