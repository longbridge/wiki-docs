Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes areÂ four-digit numerical codes assigned by the U.S. government that categorize the industries to which companies belong, while also organizing industries by their business activities. The SIC codes were created by the U.S. government in 1937 to classify and analyze economic activity across various industries and government agencies, and to promote uniformity in the presentation of statistical data collected by various government agencies SIC codes have also been adopted in places outside the U.S., including in the U.K.However, Standard Industrial Classification codes were mostly replaced in 1997 by a system of six-digit codes called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The NAICS codes were adopted in part to standardize industry data collection and analysis between Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which had entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement.Despite having been replaced, government agencies and companies still use the SIC standardized codes today for classifying the industry that companies belong to by matching their business activity with like companies.
