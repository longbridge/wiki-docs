Available-for-sale financial assets refer to financial assets that a company owns and can be sold at any time.

The value of available-for-sale financial assets will change with changes in market conditions.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Available-for-sale financial assets are financial assets that a company holds and can sell at any time. These assets can include stocks, bonds, and funds, and the company can decide when to sell them based on market conditions. The value of available-for-sale financial assets fluctuates with market conditions.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of available-for-sale financial assets originated from the International Accounting Standard (IAS 39), issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) in 2001. Its purpose was to standardize the classification and measurement of financial assets, helping companies more accurately reflect their financial status.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Available-for-sale financial assets mainly include stocks, bonds, and funds. They are characterized by high liquidity, allowing companies to adjust their investment portfolios flexibly according to market conditions. Additionally, the fair value of these assets is reflected in the balance sheet, but unrealized gains or losses are typically recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than directly affecting the current profit and loss.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A company holds a batch of publicly traded stocks as available-for-sale financial assets. When the market is favorable, the company decides to sell some stocks to realize gains, which helps reflect higher profitability in its financial statements. Case Study 2: Another company holds government bonds as available-for-sale financial assets. When interest rates fall, the company chooses to sell the bonds to lock in capital gains, thereby optimizing its investment returns.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face include accurately assessing the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets and handling unrealized gains or losses. Typically, companies need to conduct fair value assessments based on market prices and relevant accounting standards and disclose them appropriately in financial statements.</p>`} id={66} />
