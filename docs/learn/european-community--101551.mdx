The European Community (EC) was an economic association formed by six European member countries in 1957, consisting of three communities that eventually were replaced by the European Union (EU) in 1993. The European Community dealt with policies and governing, in a communal fashion, across all member states.The primary goal of the European Community was to foster a common trade policy that would eliminate trade barriers, thereby improving economic conditions for the entire region. Additionally, government officials from member states (who were well aware of the tensions still simmering in the aftermath of World War II) wanted to promote a high level of integration and cooperation in order to reduce the likelihood of future wars.
