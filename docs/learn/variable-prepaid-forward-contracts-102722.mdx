Through a VPFC, he receives partial cash at the time of the contract and delivers the corresponding number of shares based on the stock price at maturity, thereby locking in some gains.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Is VPFC suitable for all investors?</strong> No, VPFCs are typically suitable for investors holding a large number of shares and looking to defer taxes.</li><li><strong>What are the main risks of VPFC?</strong> The main risks include market volatility and the legal complexities of the contract terms.</li></ul></p>`} id={102722} />
