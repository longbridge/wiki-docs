According to the tax authorities' requirements, the company needs to prepay income tax at the end of each quarter. Therefore, the company prepays 250,000 yuan in income tax each quarter (1 million yuan × 25% ÷ 4).</p><p>Case 2: A retail company estimates monthly sales revenue of 2 million yuan with a VAT rate of 13%. According to the tax authorities' requirements, the company needs to prepay VAT at the end of each month. Therefore, the company prepays 260,000 yuan in VAT each month (2 million yuan × 13%).</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. <strong>Can prepaid taxes be refunded?</strong> If the actual tax payable by the business is less than the prepaid amount, the business can apply for a refund of the excess amount.</p><p>2. <strong>How are prepaid taxes calculated?</strong> Prepaid taxes are usually calculated based on the business's estimated income and profits, with specific methods prescribed by the tax authorities.</p>`} id={292} />
