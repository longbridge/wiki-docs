The gross spread is the compensation that the underwriters of an initial public offering (IPO) receive. An IPO is the process of taking a private corporation public by issuing shares of stock. Gross spread is the difference between the underwriting price received by the issuing company and the actual price offered to the investing public. In other words, the gross spread is the financial institution's cut or profit from the IPO listing. Gross spread is also called "gross underwriting spread," "spread," or "production."
