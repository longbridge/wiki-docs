A forward exchange contract (FEC) is a special type of over-the-counter (OTC) foreign currency (forex) transaction entered into in order to exchange currencies that are not often traded in forex markets. These may include minor currencies as well as blocked or otherwise inconvertible currencies. An FEC involving such a blocked currency is known as a non-deliverable forward, or NDF.Broadly speaking, forward contracts are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange a pair of currencies at a specific time in the future. These transactions typically take place on a date after the date that the spot contract settles and are used to protect the buyer from fluctuations in currency prices.
