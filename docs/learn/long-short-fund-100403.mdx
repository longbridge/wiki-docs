A long/short fund is a type of mutual fund or hedge fund that takes both long and short positions in investments typically from a specific market segment. These funds often use several alternative investing techniques such as leverage, derivatives, and short positions to purchases relatively undervalued securities and sell overvalued ones. Long/short funds may also be referred to as enhanced funds or 130/30 funds.
