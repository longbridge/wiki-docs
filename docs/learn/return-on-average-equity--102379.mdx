Return on average equity (ROAE) is a financial ratio that measures the performance of a company based on its average shareholders' equity outstanding. Typically, ROAE refers to a company's performance over a fiscal year, so the ROAE numerator is net income and the denominator is computed as the sum of the equity value at the beginning and end of the year, divided by 2.Return on average equity differs from the more common Return on Equity (ROE), which measures net income for the year divided by the amount of shareholder equity at the end of the year, which can be subject to stocks sales, dividend payments, and other share dilutions.
