The term junior security refers to a security with a lower priority than others. Put simply, junior security is subordinate to any other type of security. This means that junior security holders get paid only after those who own senior securities if and when a company goes bankrupt or is liquidated. As such, there's a very good chance that some (or even all) of the junior securities to which a company owes money may not be repaid after any leftover cash is distributed.
