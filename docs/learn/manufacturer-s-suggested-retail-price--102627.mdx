The manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail price (MSRP) is the price that a product's manufacturer recommends it be sold for at the point of sale. Any retail product can have an MSRP, but the term is frequently used with automobiles. An MSRP is sometimes informally known as the "sticker price."The MSRP is also referred to as the list price by some retailers. Other higher-priced goods, such as appliances and electronics, may have an MSRP as well.The MSRP is designed to keep prices at the same level from store to store. But retailers are not required to use this price, and consumers do not always pay the MSRP when they make purchases. Items may be sold for a lower price so a company can reasonably move inventory off shelves, especially in a sluggish economy.
