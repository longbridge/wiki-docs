The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation ratio that compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company’s sales or revenues.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio) is a valuation metric that compares a company's stock price to its revenue. It indicates the value the financial market places on each dollar of the company's sales. The formula for calculating the P/S ratio is:<br/><code>P/S Ratio = Stock Price per Share / Sales per Share</code>. This ratio helps investors assess whether a company is overvalued or undervalued.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of the P/S ratio was first introduced in the 1980s by renowned investment analyst Kenneth Fisher. He detailed this ratio in his book "Super Stocks," emphasizing its importance in evaluating high-growth companies.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>High P/S Ratio:</strong> Typically indicates high market expectations for future growth but may also suggest that the company is overvalued.<br/>2. <strong>Low P/S Ratio:</strong> May indicate that the company is undervalued but could also reflect potential issues or poor growth prospects.<br/>3. <strong>Industry Differences:</strong> P/S ratios vary across industries. For example, tech companies usually have higher P/S ratios, while traditional manufacturing companies have lower P/S ratios.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose Company A has a stock price of $50 per share and sales per share of $10. Its P/S ratio would be 5, meaning the market is willing to pay $5 for every dollar of Company A's sales.<br/>2. <strong>Case 2:</strong> Company B has a stock price of $30 per share and sales per share of $15. Its P/S ratio would be 2, indicating a lower valuation compared to Company A, which might suggest it is undervalued or that the market has lower growth expectations for it.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Why isn't a high P/S ratio always a good investment?</strong><br/>A high P/S ratio may indicate high market expectations for future growth, but if the company fails to meet these expectations, its stock price could decline.<br/>2. <strong>Is the P/S ratio applicable to all industries?</strong><br/>Different industries have different P/S ratio standards, so it's important to consider industry differences when using the P/S ratio for comparisons.</p>`} id={100167} />
