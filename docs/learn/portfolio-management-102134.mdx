<AIContent content={`<h2>Portfolio Management</h2><p>Portfolio Management refers to the professional financial management process that involves selecting, monitoring, and optimizing a group of financial assets to achieve specific investment goals. This process includes asset allocation, portfolio construction, risk management, and performance evaluation, aiming to maximize returns and minimize risks. Portfolio management can be executed by individual investors, self-managed groups, or professional financial advisors and fund managers.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of portfolio management can be traced back to the 1950s when Harry Markowitz introduced the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). This theory emphasizes reducing risk through diversification and forms the basis for asset allocation and risk management principles.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Portfolio management can be divided into two main categories: active management and passive management:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Management:</strong> Fund managers or financial advisors actively select and adjust the assets in the portfolio through research and analysis, aiming to achieve returns above the market average. It requires high professional knowledge and time investment.</li><li><strong>Passive Management:</strong> By replicating market indices (such as the S&P 500), the goal is to achieve returns equivalent to the market average. It features lower costs and is suitable for long-term investment.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose a financial advisor manages a portfolio for a client who aims to achieve steady capital growth over 10 years while maintaining a moderate risk level. The advisor first conducts asset allocation, selecting an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Then, the advisor constructs a diversified portfolio by choosing specific stocks and bonds. The advisor continuously monitors the portfolio's performance, evaluates whether it meets the client's investment goals, and makes adjustments based on market changes and client needs.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A young individual investor decides to manage their portfolio independently. They choose a passive management strategy by purchasing several low-cost index funds to diversify investment risks. These funds cover different markets and asset classes, such as U.S. stocks, international stocks, and bonds. The investor regularly reviews the portfolio's performance and makes minor adjustments based on their risk tolerance and market changes.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>1. Is portfolio management suitable for everyone?</strong><br/>Portfolio management is suitable for most investors, but specific strategies should be tailored to individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.</p><p><strong>2. How to choose the right asset allocation?</strong><br/>Asset allocation should be based on the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, younger investors can opt for a higher proportion of stocks, while those nearing retirement should increase the proportion of bonds and cash.</p><p><strong>3. Which is better, active management or passive management?</strong><br/>This depends on the investor's goals and preferences. Active management may offer higher returns but comes with higher fees and risks; passive management has lower costs and is suitable for long-term investment.</p>`} id={102134} />
