<p>OTC options, or Over-The-Counter options, are options contracts that are traded in the OTC market rather than on a centralized exchange. Unlike standardized exchange-traded options, OTC options are customized contracts negotiated directly between the parties involved, offering greater flexibility. OTC options can cover a wide range of underlying assets, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and more. The terms of OTC options, such as strike price, expiration date, and contract size, can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the parties involved. While OTC options provide greater flexibility, they also carry higher credit risk since there is no centralized clearinghouse to guarantee the fulfillment of the contracts.</p>
