Accounts receivable aging is a periodic report that categorizes a company's accounts receivable according to the length of time an invoice has been outstanding. It is used as a gauge to determine the financial health and reliability of a company's customers.If the accounts receivable aging shows a company's receivables are being collected much more slowly than normal,Â this is a warning sign that business may be slowing down or that the company is taking greater credit risk in its sales practices.
