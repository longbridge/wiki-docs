<p>Other income refers to the income earned by a company outside of its primary business activities. This typically includes interest income, rental income, investment gains, foreign exchange gains, government grants, and penalty income. Although these sources are not the main revenue streams, they still impact the financial health and profitability of the company. In financial statements, other income is usually listed separately to provide a clearer picture of the company's income structure.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other income refers to the revenue that a company earns outside of its primary business activities. It typically includes interest income, rental income, investment income, foreign exchange gains, government grants, and fines. Although these are not the main sources of a company's revenue, they can still significantly impact the company's financial status and profitability. In financial statements, other income is usually listed separately to provide a clearer picture of the company's income structure.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of other income emerged as corporate financial management became more complex. With the increasing diversification and globalization of business operations, companies' revenue sources have become more varied, necessitating the separate listing of these non-core business revenues in financial statements for better financial analysis.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other income can be categorized into various types, including but not limited to: interest income, rental income, investment income, foreign exchange gains, government grants, and fines. Each category has its specific source and characteristics. For example, interest income typically comes from a company's cash deposits or bond investments, while rental income is derived from leasing out company-owned properties. Investment income may arise from investments in stocks or other financial instruments. Government grants are funds provided by the government to support business development.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A technology company invests its idle funds in the short-term bond market, earning substantial interest income. This income is classified as other income, helping the company maintain stable financial performance during fluctuations in its core business revenue. Case Study 2: A real estate company earns rental income by leasing out some of its idle properties. This income is listed as other income in its financial statements, increasing the company's total revenue.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often overlook the impact of other income on a company's overall profitability. A common misconception is that other income is unimportant, but in reality, it can provide financial cushioning when core business revenue is unstable. Additionally, investors should be aware of the sustainability of other income, as some sources may be one-time gains.</p>`} id={37} />
