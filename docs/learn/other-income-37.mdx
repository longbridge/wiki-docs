<p>Other income refers to the income earned by a company outside of its primary business activities. This typically includes interest income, rental income, investment gains, foreign exchange gains, government grants, and penalty income. Although these sources are not the main revenue streams, they still impact the financial health and profitability of the company. In financial statements, other income is usually listed separately to provide a clearer picture of the company's income structure.</p>
