The Fear & Greed Index is an index developed by CNN Business to measure investor sentiment. It indicates how emotions influence the way investors pay for stocks. The index provides a window into whether stocks are fairly priced at any given point in time. The Fear & Greed index is calculated daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly and is based on the logic that excessive fear will drive share prices down, and too much greed will drive prices up.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Fear and Greed Index, developed by CNN Business, is a tool used to measure changes in market investor sentiment. By analyzing market data and investor behavior, the index quantifies the levels of fear and greed among investors, helping them determine whether the market is reasonably priced.

However, as governments and central banks implemented large-scale stimulus measures, the market quickly rebounded, further demonstrating the index's warning function.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Can the Fear and Greed Index accurately predict market trends?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The Fear and Greed Index is primarily used to reflect market sentiment.
