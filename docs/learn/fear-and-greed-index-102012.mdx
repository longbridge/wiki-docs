The Fear & Greed Index is an index developed by CNN Business to measure investor sentiment. It indicates how emotions influence the way investors pay for stocks. The index provides a window into whether stocks are fairly priced at any given point in time. The Fear & Greed index is calculated daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly and is based on the logic that excessive fear will drive share prices down, and too much greed will drive prices up.
