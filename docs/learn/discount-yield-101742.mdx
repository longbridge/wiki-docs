The discount yield is a way of calculating a bond's return when it is sold at a discount to its face value, expressed as a percentage. Discount yield is commonly used to calculate the yield on municipal notes, commercial paper and treasury bills sold at a discount.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Discount yield is a method of calculating the yield on a bond when it is sold at a discount below its face value, expressed as a percentage. Discount yield is commonly used to calculate the yield on municipal notes, commercial paper, and Treasury bills sold at a discount.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of discount yield originated with the development of the bond market, particularly when governments and corporations issued short-term debt instruments. As financial markets matured, investors needed a way to measure the actual yield of these discount bonds to make better investment decisions.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Discount yield is primarily applied to the following types of bonds:<ul><li><strong>Municipal Notes:</strong> Issued by local governments for short-term financing. Discount yield helps investors assess the actual yield of these notes.</li><li><strong>Commercial Paper:</strong> Short-term unsecured debt instruments issued by corporations, typically to meet short-term funding needs. Discount yield allows investors to compare the yields of different commercial papers.</li><li><strong>Treasury Bills:</strong> Short-term debt instruments issued by the government, usually with a maturity of one year or less. Discount yield is a key metric for evaluating these low-risk investments.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case One:</strong> Suppose an investor purchases a one-year Treasury bill with a face value of $1,000 for $950. The discount yield is calculated as: <code>Discount Yield = [(Face Value - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price] * 100%</code>. In this example, the discount yield is <code>[(1000 - 950) / 950] * 100% ≈ 5.26%</code>.</li><li><strong>Case Two:</strong> A company issues a batch of commercial paper with a face value of $100,000, sold at a discount price of $98,000, with a maturity of 180 days. The discount yield is calculated as: <code>Discount Yield = [(100,000 - 98,000) / 98,000] * (365 / 180) * 100% ≈ 4.08%</code>.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question One:</strong> How does discount yield differ from yield to maturity (YTM)?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Discount yield only considers the purchase price and face value of the bond, while yield to maturity takes into account all cash flows, including interest payments.</li><li><strong>Question Two:</strong> Why is discount yield particularly important for short-term debt instruments?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Short-term debt instruments typically do not pay periodic interest, and discount yield provides a simple way to measure the actual yield of these instruments.</li></ul></p>`} id={101742} />
