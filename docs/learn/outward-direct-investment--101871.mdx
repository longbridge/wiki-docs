An outward direct investment (ODI) is a business strategy in which a domestic firm expands its operations to a foreign country.ODI can take many different forms depending on the company. For example, some companies will make a green field investment, which is when a parent company creates a subsidiary in a foreign country. A merger or acquisition can also occur in a foreign country (and so may be considered an outward direct investment). Finally, a company may decide to expand an existing foreign facility as part of an ODI strategy. Employing ODI is a natural progression for firms if their domestic markets become saturated and better business opportunities are available abroad.ODI is also called outward foreign direct investment or direct investment abroad. It can be contrasted with foreign direct investment, or FDI, which occurs in the opposite funding direction.
