<p>A sinking fund is a dedicated fund established by a corporation or government to set aside money over time to repay debt or bonds in the future. By making regular deposits into the fund, it ensures that there are sufficient funds available to pay off the principal and interest when the debt matures, thereby reducing the risk of default. Sinking funds are typically created when bonds are issued and are accumulated according to a predetermined schedule. This arrangement helps to build confidence among bondholders, as it shows that the issuer is proactively managing its debt obligations.</p>
