Bad debt provision refers to the funds or assets that a company prepares in advance to cope with possible bad debt losses. Bad debt refers to accounts receivable that a company is unable to recover from debtors, possibly due to debtor bankruptcy, debt evasion, etc. In order to mitigate the risk of bad debts, a company will make provisions for bad debt based on historical experience and risk assessment, to offset potential losses.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The allowance for bad debts refers to funds or assets set aside by a company to cover potential losses from bad debts. Bad debts are accounts receivable that a company cannot collect from debtors, possibly due to bankruptcy or debt evasion. To mitigate bad debt risks, companies estimate and set aside an allowance for bad debts based on historical experience and risk assessment to cover potential losses.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of an allowance for bad debts originated from the need for risk management in corporate accounting practices. As business transactions became more complex and credit sales more prevalent, the risk of bad debts increased. In the early 20th century, with the establishment of modern accounting systems, the allowance for bad debts became an essential part of corporate financial statements.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>The allowance for bad debts is typically divided into two categories: specific allowance and general allowance. A specific allowance is made for accounts receivable from particular debtors who may not be able to pay, while a general allowance is an estimate based on the historical loss rate of the company's overall accounts receivable. Specific allowances are more precise but require detailed debtor information; general allowances are simpler and suitable for managing large-scale accounts receivable.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A large retail company faced the risk of a major supplier's bankruptcy in 2018. The company set aside a $5 million specific allowance for bad debts based on historical data and the supplier's financial condition, successfully offsetting the financial loss from the supplier's bankruptcy. Case Study 2: A tech company increased its general allowance for bad debts during the 2020 pandemic due to decreased customer payment capabilities, reflecting a more conservative financial position in its financial statements and gaining investor trust.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand the allowance for bad debts as actual losses, whereas it is merely an estimate of potential losses. Additionally, an excessively high allowance may lead to underestimated profits, while a low allowance might conceal financial risks. Companies need to reasonably estimate the allowance for bad debts based on actual conditions to balance risk and financial performance.</p>`} id={78} />
