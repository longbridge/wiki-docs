<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Asset impairment refers to the situation where the book value of an asset, after considering depreciation or amortization, is lower than its recoverable amount. In simple terms, it reflects the current value of the resources owned by a company from an accounting perspective. This value is included in the company's balance sheet and financial statements. Asset impairment is also known as book value or net book value.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of asset impairment originated from the development of accounting standards, particularly in the late 20th century when the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) began to emphasize the importance of asset impairment. In 1998, the IASC issued International Accounting Standard 36: Impairment of Assets, marking the formal establishment of this concept.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Asset impairment is mainly divided into two categories: tangible asset impairment and intangible asset impairment.
