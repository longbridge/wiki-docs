Okun's Law is an empirically observed relationship between unemployment and losses in a country's production. It predicts that a 1% increase in unemployment will usually be associated with a 2% drop in gross domestic product (GDP).When economists are studying the economy, they tend to hone in on two factors: output and jobs. Because there is a relationship between these two elements of an economy, many economists study the relationship between output (or more specifically, gross domestic product) and unemployment levels. Okun's Law looks at the statistical relationship between GDP and unemployment. Okun's Law can also be used to estimate gross national product (GNP).
