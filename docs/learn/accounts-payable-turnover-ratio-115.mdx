<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Accounts Payable Turnover Ratio is a metric that measures the frequency and efficiency with which a company pays its accounts payable. It indicates the number of times a company pays off its accounts payable within a certain period. A higher accounts payable turnover ratio typically signifies stronger payment capability.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the accounts payable turnover ratio originated from liquidity analysis in financial management, first introduced in the early 20th century to assess a company's short-term debt-paying ability. With the development of modern business management theories, this metric has become widely used in corporate financial analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The accounts payable turnover ratio can be categorized by time periods, such as monthly, quarterly, and annually. Its characteristics include: 1. Reflecting the efficiency of a company in paying its suppliers; 2. A higher turnover ratio indicates faster payment speed and better financial health; 3.

Accounts Payable Turnover Ratio = 3 million / 0.5 million = 6 times.
