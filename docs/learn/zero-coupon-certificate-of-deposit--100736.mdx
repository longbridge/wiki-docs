A zero-coupon certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of CD that does not pay interest during its term. Instead, zero-coupon CDs provide a return by being sold for less than their face value. This means that an investor would receive more than their initial investment once the CD reaches its maturity date. This provides the investor with a return on investment (ROI), even though no interest payments were made prior to the maturity date.By contrast, traditional CDs pay interest periodically throughout their term, usually on an annual basis. Both zero-coupon CDs and regular CDs are popular options among risk-averse investors because they offer guaranteed principal protection. Zero-coupon CDs, however, may be especially attractive for investors who are not particularly concerned with generating cashflow during the investment term.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A zero-coupon certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of CD that does not pay interest during its term. Instead, it is sold at a discount to its face value, providing a return upon maturity. This means that once the CD reaches its maturity date, the investor will receive a return greater than their initial investment. This offers an investment return (ROI) despite no interest payments being made before maturity.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of zero-coupon CDs originated in the early 20th century and was first widely used in the United States. They were initially designed to meet the needs of investors who wanted to receive a fixed amount at a specific future date. Over time, zero-coupon CDs have been adopted by financial institutions worldwide, becoming a common investment tool.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Zero-coupon CDs are mainly divided into two categories: government-issued zero-coupon CDs and commercial bank-issued zero-coupon CDs. Government-issued zero-coupon CDs are generally considered lower risk due to being backed by national credit. In contrast, commercial bank-issued zero-coupon CDs may offer higher returns but come with relatively higher risks. Key characteristics of zero-coupon CDs include: 1. No periodic interest payments; 2. Purchased at a discount; 3. Receive face value upon maturity; 4. Suitable for investors who do not need regular cash flow.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Xiao Ming purchases a zero-coupon CD with a face value of 10,000 yuan at a price of 9,000 yuan, with a term of 5 years. Upon maturity, Xiao Ming will receive 10,000 yuan, equivalent to an annualized return of approximately 2.1%. Case 2: A company buys a batch of government-issued zero-coupon CDs with a face value of 1 million yuan at a price of 850,000 yuan, with a term of 10 years. Upon maturity, the company will receive 1 million yuan, which will be used for future project investments.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What are the main risks of zero-coupon CDs? Answer: The main risks include the credit risk of the issuing institution and market interest rate fluctuation risk. 2. Who are zero-coupon CDs suitable for? Answer: They are suitable for investors who do not need regular cash flow and wish to receive a fixed amount at a specific future date.</p>`} id={100736} />
