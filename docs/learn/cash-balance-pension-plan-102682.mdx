A cash balance pension plan is a defined-benefit pension planÂ with the option of a lifetime annuity. The employer credits a participant's account with a set percentage of their yearly compensation plus interest charges for a cash balance plan. The funding limits, funding requirements, and investment risk are based on defined-benefit requirements. Changes in the portfolio do not affect the final benefits received by the participant upon retirement or termination, and the company bears all ownership of profits and losses in the portfolio.
