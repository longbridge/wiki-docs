A handle is the whole number part of a price quote, that is, the portion of the quote to the left of the decimal point. For example, if the price quote for the stock is $56.25, the handle is $56, eliminating the value of cents in the quote. Handles are often used in futures and equities markets, where they are also known as the big figure, or "big fig".In foreign exchange markets, the handle refers to the part of the price quote that appears in both the bid and the offer for the currency. For example, if the EUR/USD currency pair has a bid of 1.4183 and an ask of 1.4185, the handle would be 1.41 – the part of the quote that is equal to both the bid and the ask.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The integer part of the price refers to the whole number part of a quote, which is the part to the left of the decimal point. For example, if a stock is quoted at $56.25, the integer part of the price is $56, excluding the decimal value. The integer part of the price is often used in futures and stock markets and is also known as the 'big figure' or 'big fig.' In the forex market, the integer part of the price refers to the part of the quote that appears in both the bid and ask prices. For example, if the EUR/USD currency pair has a bid price of 1.4183 and an ask price of 1.4185, the integer part of the price is 1.41, which is the part that is the same in both the bid and ask prices.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the integer part of the price originated from the quoting systems in financial markets. As financial markets evolved, traders needed a simple way to quickly identify and compare the prices of different assets, leading to the use of the integer part of the price. Especially before the advent of electronic trading, traders used verbal or written quotes, and the integer part of the price facilitated quick communication and understanding.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The application of the integer part of the price varies across different markets. In stock and futures markets, the integer part of the price is typically used to simplify quotes and analysis. For example, if a stock price is $56.25, the integer part of the price is $56, making it easier to quickly compare and calculate. In the forex market, the integer part of the price is more critical because forex quotes usually have more decimal places. For example, if the EUR/USD bid price is 1.4183 and the ask price is 1.4185, the integer part of the price is 1.41, helping traders quickly identify market trends.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Stock Market:</strong> Suppose a stock's current quote is $123.45, and the integer part of the price is $123. Investors can use the integer part of the price to judge the stock's price range and trend. For example, if the stock price rises from $120 to $130, investors can observe changes in the integer part of the price to gauge market sentiment.<br/>2. <strong>Forex Market:</strong> Suppose the EUR/USD bid price is 1.2345, and the ask price is 1.2347, the integer part of the price is 1.23. Forex traders can use the integer part of the price to determine the currency pair's volatility range and market trend. For example, if the integer part of the price changes from 1.23 to 1.24, traders can infer an appreciation trend of the euro against the dollar.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Why is the integer part of the price important?</strong> The integer part of the price simplifies the quoting and analysis process, allowing traders to quickly determine market trends and price ranges.<br/>2. <strong>Is the integer part of the price applicable to all markets?</strong> The integer part of the price is mainly applicable to stock, futures, and forex markets, but similar applications exist in other markets as well.</p>`} id={101973} />
