<p>A Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) is a form of equity compensation granted by companies to employees, typically as part of their compensation package. RSUs do not provide actual stock at the time of grant; instead, they are converted into actual shares or cash upon meeting specific conditions, such as tenure or performance goals.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a form of equity compensation granted by companies to employees, typically as part of their compensation package. RSUs do not represent actual shares at the time of grant but convert into actual shares or cash upon meeting specific conditions, such as tenure or performance goals. The purpose of RSUs is to incentivize employees to stay with the company long-term and improve company performance.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of RSUs originated in the 1980s when companies began seeking new ways to motivate and retain key employees. Over time, RSUs have become a popular equity incentive tool, especially among tech companies and startups. Key events include the widespread adoption of RSUs by tech companies during the dot-com boom of the 1990s to attract and retain talent.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Grant Conditions:</strong> RSUs typically come with specific grant conditions, such as tenure, performance goals, or company-specific events (e.g., IPO).<br/>2. <strong>Stock Units:</strong> At the time of grant, RSUs are merely stock units and do not represent actual shares.<br/>3. <strong>Conversion to Shares:</strong> Upon meeting the grant conditions, RSUs convert into actual shares or cash payments to the employee.<br/>4. <strong>Incentive Effect:</strong> RSUs aim to incentivize employees to stay with the company long-term and improve company performance, aligning employee interests with those of the company.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case One:</strong> Suppose a company grants an employee 1,000 RSUs, with the condition that the employee must work for the company for four consecutive years, unlocking 25% of the RSUs each year. If the employee leaves at the end of the first year, they forfeit all unvested RSUs. If the employee stays for four years, all 1,000 RSUs vest and convert into 1,000 actual shares or their cash equivalent.<br/>2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> Another company grants an executive 5,000 RSUs, with the condition that the company must meet specific financial targets over the next three years. If the company achieves these targets within three years, the executive receives 5,000 actual shares or their cash equivalent. If the targets are not met, the executive forfeits the RSUs.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>How do RSUs differ from stock options?</strong> RSUs do not require employees to pay any amount at the time of grant, whereas stock options typically require employees to pay an exercise price when exercising the options.<br/>2. <strong>How are RSUs taxed?</strong> RSUs are generally considered taxable income at the time of vesting, and employees must pay income tax on their value.</p>`} id={102112} />
