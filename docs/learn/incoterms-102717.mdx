<p>To facilitate commerce around the world, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)&nbsp;publishes a set of Incoterms, officially known as international commercial terms. Globally recognized, Incoterms prevent confusion in&nbsp;foreign trade contracts by clarifying the obligations of buyers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>Parties involved in&nbsp;domestic and international trade commonly use Incoterms as a kind of shorthand to help understand one another and the exact terms of their business arrangements. Some Incoterms apply to any means of transportation, while others apply strictly to transportation across water.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) are a set of international trade terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to define the responsibilities and obligations of buyers and sellers in international trade. These terms standardize trade practices, reducing confusion and disputes in international trade contracts.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Incoterms were first published in 1936 to address common misunderstandings and disputes in international trade. The ICC has since regularly updated these terms to adapt to changes in the global trade environment, with the most recent update in 2020.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Incoterms are divided into two main categories: terms applicable to any mode of transport (e.g., EXW, FCA, CPT, CIP, DAP, DPU, DDP) and terms applicable only to sea and inland waterway transport (e.g., FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF). The former are more flexible and can be used for various transport modes, while the latter are specifically designed for port-to-port sea transport.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. FOB (Free On Board): The buyer is responsible for all costs and risks from the port of shipment. For example, a Chinese company exports electronic products to a US company under FOB Shanghai terms. The Chinese company is responsible for delivering the goods to Shanghai port and loading them onto the ship, while the US company takes over costs and risks from Shanghai port onwards. 2. CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight): The seller covers the cost, insurance, and freight to the destination port. For example, a German company exports machinery to a Brazilian company under CIF Rio de Janeiro terms. The German company is responsible for delivering the goods to Rio de Janeiro port and paying for the freight and insurance, while the Brazilian company takes over costs and risks from the destination port onwards.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How to choose the appropriate Incoterm? The choice depends on the negotiation power of both parties, the mode of transport, and the willingness to bear risks. 2. Can standard Incoterms be modified? Yes, but any modifications must be clearly stated in the contract to avoid disputes.</p>`} id={102717} />
