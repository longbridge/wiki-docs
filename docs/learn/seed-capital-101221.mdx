The term seed capital refers to the type of financing used in the formation of a startup. Funding is provided by private investorsâ€”usually in exchange for an equity stake in the company or for a share in the profits of a product. Much of the seed capital a company raises may come from sources close to its founders including family, friends, and other acquaintances. Obtaining seed capital is the first of four funding stages required for a startup to become an established business.
