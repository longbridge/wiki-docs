Governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) is a relatively new corporate management system that integrates these three crucial functions into the processes of every department within an organization.GRC is in part a response to the "silo mentality," as it has become disparagingly known. That is, each department within a company can become reluctant to share information or resources with any other department. This is seen as reducing efficiency, damaging morale, and preventing the development of a positive company culture.
