An ultra-short bond fund is a bond fund that invests only in fixed-income instruments with very short-term maturities. An ultra-short bond fund will invest in instruments with maturities of less than one year. Because of their focus on bonds with very short durations, these portfolios offer minimal interest-rate sensitivity and therefore lower risk and total return potential.Â This strategy, however, tends to offer higher yields than money market instruments with fewer price fluctuations than a typical short-term fund.Note that a short-term bond fund like this should not be confused with a bear bond fund or ETF that goes short bonds on a leveraged basis.
