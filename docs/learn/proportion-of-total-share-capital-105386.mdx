The proportion of total share capital refers to the ratio of the number of shares held by a specific shareholder to the total share capital of the company. This ratio can be used to evaluate the shareholder's control and influence over the company.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Total Shareholding Ratio</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Total shareholding ratio refers to the proportion of a specific shareholder's shares in a company relative to the company's total share capital. This ratio can be used to assess the shareholder's control and influence over the company.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of total shareholding ratio originated from the study of corporate governance and shareholder rights. With the development of joint-stock companies, the shareholding ratio became an important indicator of a shareholder's voice in company decisions. As early as the 19th century, with the popularization of joint-stock companies, the concept of shareholding ratio was widely accepted and applied.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Total shareholding ratio can be divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Controlling Shareholder Ratio:</strong> Usually refers to shareholders holding more than 50% of the company's shares, having absolute control.</li><li><strong>Major Shareholder Ratio:</strong> Refers to shareholders holding 10%-50% of the company's shares, having significant influence but not absolute control.</li><li><strong>Minor Shareholder Ratio:</strong> Refers to shareholders holding less than 10% of the company's shares, having limited influence.</li></ul><p>Characteristics:</p><ul><li>Companies with a high controlling shareholder ratio have high decision-making efficiency but may face the risk of “one dominant shareholder”.</li><li>Companies with a moderate major shareholder ratio have relatively democratic decision-making but may face conflicts of interest among shareholders.</li><li>Companies with a high minor shareholder ratio have complex decision-making processes and need to balance multiple interests.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case One:</strong> Company A has a total share capital of 10 million shares, and shareholder B holds 6 million shares, so shareholder B's total shareholding ratio is 60%. As a controlling shareholder, shareholder B has absolute control and can decide on major company matters.</p><p><strong>Case Two:</strong> Company C has a total share capital of 5 million shares, and shareholder D holds 1 million shares, so shareholder D's total shareholding ratio is 20%. As a major shareholder, shareholder D does not have absolute control but has significant influence in company decisions.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question One:</strong> Is a higher total shareholding ratio always better?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Not necessarily. A higher total shareholding ratio gives the shareholder greater control but may also lead to the risk of “one dominant shareholder”, affecting the balance of the company's governance structure.</p><p><strong>Question Two:</strong> How to calculate the total shareholding ratio?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Total shareholding ratio = (Number of shares held by a shareholder / Total share capital of the company) × 100%.</p>`} id={105386} />
