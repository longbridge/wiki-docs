<p>A bounced check, also known as a dishonored check, occurs when a bank refuses to honor a check because the account it is drawn on does not have sufficient funds or other issues prevent the payment. When a check bounces, the bank typically charges a fee to the check writer and notifies the payee. Bouncing a check can negatively impact the check writer's credit history and may lead to legal consequences. To avoid bouncing checks, the check writer should ensure there are sufficient funds in the account to cover the check amount and regularly monitor the account balance.</p>
