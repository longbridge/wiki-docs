A bounced check is slang for a check that cannot be processed because the account holder has non-sufficient funds (NSF) available for use. Banks return, or “bounce,” these checks, also known as rubber checks, rather than honor them, and banks charge the check writers NSF fees.Passing bad checks can be illegal, and the crime can range from a misdemeanor to a felony, depending on the amount of the check and whether the activity involved crossing state lines.
