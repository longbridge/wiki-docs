The quick ratio is a measure of a company's short-term solvency, calculated as (current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses) / current liabilities. The quick ratio excludes inventory and prepaid expenses, thus focusing more on the ability of a company to immediately repay debts without inventory and prepaid expenses. A higher quick ratio indicates a stronger short-term solvency for the company.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The quick ratio is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity, calculated as (current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses) / current liabilities. By excluding inventory and prepaid expenses, the quick ratio focuses on a company's ability to immediately pay off its debts without relying on inventory and prepaid expenses. A higher quick ratio indicates stronger short-term liquidity.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the quick ratio originated in the early 20th century, evolving with the development of modern corporate financial management theories. It is an improved version of the current ratio, designed to provide a more conservative and accurate assessment of short-term liquidity.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The quick ratio has the following characteristics: 1. More conservative: Excludes inventory and prepaid expenses from current assets, providing a more conservative liquidity assessment. 2. Wide applicability: Suitable for various types of companies, especially those with slow inventory turnover or high prepaid expenses. 3. Simple calculation: The formula is straightforward, allowing financial personnel and investors to quickly calculate and analyze.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A manufacturing company has current assets of 1 million yuan, inventory of 300,000 yuan, prepaid expenses of 100,000 yuan, and current liabilities of 500,000 yuan. Its quick ratio is (1,000,000 - 300,000 - 100,000) / 500,000 = 1.2, indicating that the company has sufficient current assets to pay off short-term debts without relying on inventory and prepaid expenses. Case 2: A service company has current assets of 800,000 yuan, inventory of 50,000 yuan, prepaid expenses of 150,000 yuan, and current liabilities of 400,000 yuan. Its quick ratio is (800,000 - 50,000 - 150,000) / 400,000 = 1.5, indicating strong short-term liquidity.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What is a reasonable quick ratio? Generally, a quick ratio above 1 is considered ideal, but specific circumstances should be analyzed based on industry characteristics and the company's actual situation. 2. Is a higher quick ratio always better? An excessively high quick ratio may indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its current assets for investment or business expansion, so it should be considered comprehensively.</p>`} id={273} />
