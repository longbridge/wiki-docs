Factors of production are the inputs needed for creating a good or service, and the factors of production include land, labor, entrepreneurship, and capital.Those who control the factors of production often enjoy the greatest wealth in a society. In capitalism, the factors of production are most often controlled by business owners and investors. In socialist systems, the government (or community) often exerts greater control over the factors of production.
