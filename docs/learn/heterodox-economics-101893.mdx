Heterodox economicsÂ is the analysis and study of economic principles considered outside of mainstream or orthodox schools of economic thought. Schools of heterodox economics vary widely and have few common characteristics other than propounding theories, assumptions, or methodologies that fall outside of or contradict the mainstream Keynesian and neoclassical movements.Heterodox schools of thought include far-left theories such as socialism, Marxism, and post-Keynesian economics, as well as those associated with radical free-market economics such as the Austrian school. Heterodox economists often employ research methods and tools that originate in other disciplines, such as psychology or physics, to economic questions.
