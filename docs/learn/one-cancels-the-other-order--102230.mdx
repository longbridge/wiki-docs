A one-cancels-the-other (OCO) order is a pair of conditional orders stipulating that if one order executes, then the other order is automatically canceled. An OCO order often combines a stop order with a limit order on an automated trading platform. When either the stop or limit price is reached and the order is executed, the other order is automatically canceled. Experienced traders use OCO orders to mitigate risk and enter the market.OCO orders may contrast with order-sends-order (OSO) conditions that trigger, rather than cancel, a second order.
