A short call is an options position taken as a trading strategy when a trader believes that the price of the asset underlying the option will drop. Therefore, it's considered a bearish trading strategy.Short calls have limited profit potential and the theoretical risk of unlimited loss. They're usually used only by experienced traders and investors.
