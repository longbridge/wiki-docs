Forensic auditors work closely with lawyers, law enforcement agencies, and other regulatory bodies to uncover evidence of wrongdoing and provide detailed reports and testimonies. The objective of a forensic audit is not only to detect financial misconduct but also to prevent and mitigate future risks.</p>
