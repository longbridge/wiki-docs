Vega neutral is a method of managing risk in options trading by establishing a hedge against the implied volatility of the underlying asset.Vega is one of the options GreeksÂ along with delta, gamma, rho and theta. Vega is the Greek that corresponds with the Black-Scholes price factor for volatility, but it represents the sensitivity of the price of an option to volatility and not volatility itself. Options traders will use a vega neutral strategy when they believe that volatility presents a risk to the profits.
