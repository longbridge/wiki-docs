A high ratio loan is a loan whereby the loan value is high relative to the property value being used as collateral. Mortgage loans that have high loan ratios have a loan value that approaches 100% of the value of the property. A high ratio loan might be approved for a borrower who is unable to put down a large down payment.For mortgages, a high ratio loan usually means the loan value exceeds 80% of the property's value. The calculation is called the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which is an assessment of lending risk that financial institutions use before approving a mortgage.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A high-ratio loan refers to a loan where the loan amount is high relative to the value of the property used as collateral. Typically, a high-ratio loan's value is close to 100% of the property's value. High-ratio loans are often approved for borrowers who cannot afford a large down payment. For mortgages, a high-ratio loan usually means the loan value exceeds 80% of the property's value.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of high-ratio loans originated from financial institutions' need to cater to more borrowers. As the real estate market developed, more borrowers wanted to purchase properties with smaller down payments, prompting financial institutions to develop high-ratio loan products.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> High-ratio loans mainly fall into two categories: traditional high-ratio mortgages and government-backed high-ratio loans, such as FHA loans. Traditional high-ratio loans feature high loan amounts and low down payments but usually require borrowers to pay for private mortgage insurance (PMI). Government-backed high-ratio loans are guaranteed by government agencies and typically have lower credit requirements for borrowers.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Mr. Wang wants to buy a house worth 1 million yuan but can only afford a 200,000 yuan down payment. The bank offers him an 800,000 yuan high-ratio loan, with a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 80%. Case 2: Mr. Li uses an FHA loan to purchase a house worth 500,000 yuan, requiring only a 3.5% down payment, or 17,500 yuan, with the rest covered by the loan.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What are the risks of high-ratio loans? The risk of high-ratio loans lies in the borrower's potential inability to make timely payments, leading to loan default. 2. Are high-ratio loans suitable for everyone? High-ratio loans are suitable for borrowers who cannot afford a large down payment but have a stable income.</p>`} id={101400} />
