A high ratio loan is a loan whereby the loan value is high relative to the property value being used as collateral. Mortgage loans that have high loan ratios have a loan value that approaches 100% of the value of the property. A high ratio loan might be approved for a borrower who is unable to put down a large down payment.For mortgages, a high ratio loan usually means the loan value exceeds 80% of the property's value. The calculation is called the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which is an assessment of lending risk that financial institutions use before approving a mortgage.
