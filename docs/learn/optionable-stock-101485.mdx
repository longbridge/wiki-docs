An optionable stock is one where the shares have the necessary liquidity and volume such that an exchange lists that stock's options for trading. In order for a stock to be optionable, exchanges mandate that certain criteria be met, including a minimum share price, number of shares outstanding, and minimum unique shareholders, among others.
