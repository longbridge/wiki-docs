Horizontal equity is an economic theory that states that individuals with similar income and assets should pay the same amount in taxes. Horizontal equity should apply to individuals considered equal regardless of the tax system in place. The more neutral a tax system is the more horizontally equitable it is considered to be.This can be contrasted with vertical equity, a method of collecting income tax in which the tax rate one is subject to increases with the amount of earned income. The principle behind vertical equity is that those who have the ability to pay more taxes should contribute more than those who are not.
