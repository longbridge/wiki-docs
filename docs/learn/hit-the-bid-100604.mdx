<p>"Hit The Bid" is a term used in financial markets to describe the action of a seller accepting the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset at the current moment. This commonly occurs in markets such as stocks, bonds, and foreign exchange. When a seller "hits the bid," it means the seller is willing to sell the asset at the buyer's bid price. This action often indicates that the seller is eager to sell the asset or considers the current bid price to be a fair selling point. Conversely, when a buyer accepts the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, it is referred to as "lifting the offer."</p><p><br/>&nbsp;</p>
