"Hit the bid" is a term used when a trader agrees to sell at the bid price, the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security or asset. The "bid-ask" spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price that a sellerÂ is willing to accept. An individual looking to sell will hit the bid if they wish to transact immediately at that price.Hit the bid can be contrasted with "lift the offer."
