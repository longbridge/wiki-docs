Delivery versus payment (DVP) is a securities industry settlement method that guarantees the transfer of securities only happens after payment has been made. DVP stipulates that the buyer's cash payment for securities must be made prior to or at the same time as the delivery of the security.Delivery versus payment is the settlement process from the buyer's perspective; from the seller's perspective, this settlement system is called receive versus payment (RVP). DVP/RVP requirements emerged in the aftermath of institutions being banned from paying money for securities before the securities were held in negotiable form. DVP is also known as delivery against payment (DAP), delivery against cash (DAC), and cash on delivery.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Delivery Versus Payment (DVP)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) is a settlement method in the securities industry designed to ensure that the transfer of securities occurs only after payment has been made. According to DVP rules, the buyer must pay for the securities either before or simultaneously with the delivery of the securities. This method is viewed from the buyer's perspective as DVP, while from the seller's perspective, it is known as Receive Versus Payment (RVP).</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The DVP/RVP system emerged to mitigate the risk of paying for securities before they are held in a transferable form. As financial markets evolved and trading volumes increased, traditional settlement methods became inadequate, leading to the development of the DVP system to enhance settlement security and efficiency.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The DVP system can be categorized into the following types:</p><ul><li><strong>Primary DVP:</strong> Securities and cash are delivered simultaneously, ensuring that both parties' rights are protected at the same time.</li><li><strong>Secondary DVP:</strong> Securities and cash are delivered at different times but within a short time window, typically within the same day.</li><li><strong>Tertiary DVP:</strong> Securities and cash are delivered at different times, with a longer time window that may span multiple trading days.</li></ul><p>The main differences among these categories lie in the synchronization of delivery times and the strictness of risk control. Primary DVP has the lowest risk but is more complex to operate, while tertiary DVP is simpler but carries higher risk.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> An investment company A purchases a batch of stocks worth $1 million. Under the DVP system, investment company A must pay $1 million in cash before or simultaneously with the delivery of the stocks. This ensures that the selling company B delivers the stocks immediately upon receiving the cash, securing the transaction for both parties.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Bank C sells bonds to another bank D through the DVP system. Bank C transfers the bonds to bank D through the securities settlement system immediately after receiving payment from bank D. This method ensures that bank C does not lose ownership of the bonds without receiving payment.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is the DVP system safer than traditional settlement methods?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The DVP system reduces the risk of default by ensuring the simultaneous delivery of securities and cash, thereby enhancing settlement security.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is the DVP system applicable to all types of securities transactions?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> While the DVP system is widely used in stock and bond transactions, some complex financial derivative transactions may require a combination of other settlement methods.</p>`} id={100648} />
