A liability-driven investment (LDI) is an investment in assets that can generate the cash to pay for financial obligations (liabilities).This type of investing is common with defined-benefit pension plans because companies and pension funds are obligated to provide the guaranteed income promised to the beneficiaries. With the largest pensionÂ plans, liabilities frequently climb to billions of dollars.
