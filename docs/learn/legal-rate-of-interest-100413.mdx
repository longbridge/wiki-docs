The legal rate of interest is the highest rate of interest that can be legally charged on any type of debt, and to which a lender must adhere. The legal rate of interest applies to all types of debt, although certain types of debt may carry a higher legal rate than another—for instance, the legal limit for a payday lender may be higher than the legal limit for a student loan. The limit is set to prevent lenders from charging borrowers excessive interest rates.
