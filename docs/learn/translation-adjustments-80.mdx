<p>Translation adjustments refer to the differences that arise when a company's foreign currency financial statements are translated into the reporting currency of the parent company due to changes in exchange rates. These adjustments reflect the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the financial statements.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Foreign currency translation adjustment refers to the differences in assets, liabilities, income, and equity items caused by exchange rate fluctuations when a company prepares financial statements in foreign currencies. This adjustment arises when translating foreign currency financial statements into the reporting currency and can be determined by calculating the differences between the foreign currency statements and the reporting currency statements.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of foreign currency translation adjustment originated from the financial management needs of international trade and multinational corporations. With the development of globalization, more and more companies are conducting business in multiple countries and using different currencies for transactions. To unify financial statements, companies need to translate foreign currency statements into the reporting currency, and the differences caused by exchange rate fluctuations during this process are known as foreign currency translation adjustments.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Foreign currency translation adjustments can be divided into two main categories: adjustments arising from transactional items (such as accounts receivable and accounts payable) and adjustments arising from non-transactional items (such as long-term investments and fixed assets). Adjustments from transactional items typically affect the company's current income, while adjustments from non-transactional items may be included in equity.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A multinational company owns a fixed asset in the United States valued at $1 million. Assuming the exchange rate at the beginning of the year is 1 USD to 6.5 RMB and changes to 1 USD to 6.8 RMB by the end of the year, the value of the asset in the RMB financial statements would be 6.5 million RMB at the beginning of the year and 6.8 million RMB at the end of the year, resulting in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 300,000 RMB.</p><p>Case 2: A company has an account receivable in Europe amounting to 100,000 euros. Assuming the exchange rate at the beginning of the year is 1 EUR to 7.8 RMB and changes to 1 EUR to 8.0 RMB by the end of the year, the value of the receivable in the RMB financial statements would be 780,000 RMB at the beginning of the year and 800,000 RMB at the end of the year, resulting in a foreign currency translation adjustment of 20,000 RMB.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why does a foreign currency translation adjustment occur?<br/>Answer: Due to exchange rate fluctuations, the amounts in foreign currency statements change when translated into the reporting currency, resulting in adjustments.</p><p>2. How is the foreign currency translation adjustment handled?<br/>Answer: According to different accounting standards, foreign currency translation adjustments can be included in the current income or equity.</p>`} id={80} />
