A negotiable instrument is a signed document that promises a payment to a specified person or assignee. In other words, it is a formalized type of IOU: A transferable, signed document that promises to pay the bearer a sum of money at a future date or on-demand.Common examples of negotiable instruments include personal checks, cashier's checks, money orders, certificates of deposit (CDs), promissory notes, and traveler's checks. The person receiving the payment, known as the payee, must be named or otherwise indicated on the instrument. Because they are transferable and assignable, some negotiable instruments may trade on a secondary market.
