A binary option is a financial product where the parties involved in the transaction are assigned one of two outcomes based on whether the option expiresÂ in the money. Binary options depend on the outcome of a "yes or no" proposition, hence the name "binary." Traders receive a payout if the binary option expires in the money and incur a loss if it expires out of the money.
