An offtake agreement is an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer's upcoming goods. It is normally negotiated before the construction of a factory or facility to secure a market and revenue stream for its future output.Offtake agreements are typically used to help the selling company acquire project financing for future construction, expansion projects, or new equipment through the promise of future income and proof of existing demand for the goods.
