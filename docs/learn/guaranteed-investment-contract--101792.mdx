A guaranteed investment contract (GIC) is a contract between an insurance company and an investor, typically a pension fund or an employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k). The investor agrees to deposit a sum of money with the insurer for a specified period of time, and the insurer promises to pay the investor an agreed-upon interest rate, as well as to return its principal.Employees who participate in a 401(k) or similar plan often have GICs as one of their investment choices. GICs are sometimes called funding agreements.
