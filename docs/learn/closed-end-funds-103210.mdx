A closed-end fund is an investment fund whose portfolio typically consists of stocks, bonds, and other securities. The stocks of closed-end funds are not as readily purchasable or redeemable as those of open-end funds and are instead issued and auctioned off during specific time periods. Once the auction period is over, investors can no longer buy shares of the closed-end fund and can only trade them on the secondary market.
