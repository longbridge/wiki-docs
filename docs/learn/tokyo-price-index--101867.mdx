The Tokyo Price Index—commonly referred to as TOPIX—is a metric for stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). TOPIX is a capitalization-weighted index that lists all firms in the "first section" of the TSE, a section that organizes all large firms on the exchange into one group. The second section of the TSE pools all of the smaller remaining companies.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Tokyo Price Index (TOPIX) is a measure of stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). TOPIX is a market capitalization-weighted index that lists all companies in the TSE's 'First Section,' which organizes all large companies on the exchange into one group. The TSE's Second Section gathers all remaining smaller companies.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> TOPIX was first published on July 1, 1968, aiming to provide a more comprehensive measure of market performance. As Japan's economy rapidly developed, TOPIX gradually became an important tool for investors to assess the overall performance of the Japanese stock market.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> TOPIX is mainly divided into two sections: the First Section includes large companies, and the Second Section includes smaller companies. The characteristic of TOPIX is that it is market capitalization-weighted, meaning that companies with larger market caps have a greater impact on the index. Its advantage is that it can reflect overall market changes, but its disadvantage is that it may be dominated by a few large companies.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. During the 2008 financial crisis, TOPIX dropped significantly, reflecting the turmoil in global financial markets. 2. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, TOPIX initially fell sharply, but as the Japanese government introduced economic stimulus policies, the index gradually recovered, showing the market's positive response to the policies.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Investors often ask about the difference between TOPIX and the Nikkei 225 index. TOPIX covers more companies and reflects a broader market, while the Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted index that includes only 225 companies. 2. Another common question is how to invest in TOPIX. Investors can invest by purchasing ETFs or funds that track TOPIX.</p>`} id={101867} />
