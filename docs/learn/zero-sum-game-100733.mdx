<p>Zero-sum is a situation, often cited in game theory, in which one person’s gain is equivalent to another’s loss, so the net change in wealth or benefit is zero. A zero-sum game may have as few as two players or as many as millions of participants.In financial markets, options and futures are examples of zero-sum games, excluding transaction costs. For every person who gains on a contract, there is a counter-party who loses.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A zero-sum game is a situation often referenced in game theory where one person's gain is equivalent to another person's loss, resulting in a net change of zero in terms of wealth or benefit. Zero-sum games can involve two participants or millions. In financial markets, options and futures are examples of zero-sum games, excluding transaction costs. For every person who profits from a contract, there is a counterparty who incurs a loss.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of zero-sum games originates from game theory, a mathematical discipline that studies strategic decision-making. Game theory was developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s, and they systematically introduced this concept in their 1944 book, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior."</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Zero-sum games can be divided into two categories: complete information zero-sum games and incomplete information zero-sum games.<ul><li><strong>Complete Information Zero-Sum Games:</strong> All participants know the rules of the game and all possible strategies. For example, chess is a complete information zero-sum game.</li><li><strong>Incomplete Information Zero-Sum Games:</strong> Participants do not fully know all the information. For example, options trading in financial markets is an incomplete information zero-sum game because traders cannot fully predict market movements.</li></ul>The main characteristics of zero-sum games are:<ul><li>The total benefit of participants sums to zero.</li><li>Highly competitive, often requiring advanced strategies and skills.</li><li>Results are deterministic, meaning each participant's gains and losses are clear.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1: Options Trading:</strong> In the options market, if a trader buys a call option and profits, the trader who sold the option will incur a corresponding loss. For example, Trader A buys a call option and pays a premium of $100. If the underlying asset's price rises and A profits $200, the trader who sold the option, Trader B, will lose $200.</li><li><strong>Case 2: Futures Contracts:</strong> In the futures market, the interests of buyers and sellers are also opposed. If the buyer profits at the contract's expiration, the seller will incur a corresponding loss. For example, Trader C buys a crude oil futures contract, expecting the price to rise. If the price indeed rises and C profits $500, the seller, Trader D, will lose $500.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Are zero-sum games always fair?</strong> The fairness of zero-sum games depends on the strategies and information symmetry of the participants. If one party has more information or a higher level of strategy, the game may be unfavorable to the other party.</li><li><strong>What is the difference between zero-sum games and positive-sum games?</strong> In zero-sum games, one person's gain equals another person's loss, whereas in positive-sum games, the total gain of all participants can be positive, meaning everyone can profit.</li></ul></p>`} id={100733} />
