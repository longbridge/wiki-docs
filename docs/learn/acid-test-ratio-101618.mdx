The acid-test ratio, commonly known as the quick ratio, uses data from a firm's balance sheet to indicate whether it has the means to cover its short-term liabilities. Generally, a ratio of 1.0 or more indicates a company can pay its short-term obligations, while a ratio of less than 1.0 indicates it might struggle to pay them.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Acid-Test Ratio, also known as the Quick Ratio, is a financial metric used to assess a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. This ratio is calculated using data from the company's balance sheet and is typically used to measure liquidity and short-term solvency.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the Acid-Test Ratio originated in the early 20th century and has become widely used with the development of modern financial analysis methods. The term 'acid test' is borrowed from chemistry, where it refers to a quick test to check the purity of metals, analogous to a quick financial check.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Acid-Test Ratio can be categorized into two types: 1. Static Acid-Test Ratio: Calculated based on balance sheet data at a specific point in time; 2. Dynamic Acid-Test Ratio: Calculated based on average data over a period. Characteristics include: 1. Excludes inventory, focusing on the quality of liquid assets; 2. A ratio above 1.0 indicates strong short-term solvency; 3. A ratio below 1.0 may signal liquidity risk.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company shows current assets of $1 million (excluding inventory) and short-term liabilities of $800,000 on its balance sheet, resulting in an Acid-Test Ratio of 1.25 (1,000,000/800,000), indicating sufficient liquid assets to cover short-term liabilities. Case 2: Another company has current assets of $500,000 (excluding inventory) and short-term liabilities of $700,000, resulting in an Acid-Test Ratio of 0.71 (500,000/700,000), indicating potential short-term solvency issues.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why exclude inventory? Inventory may take time to liquidate and its value can fluctuate. 2. Does an Acid-Test Ratio below 1.0 always indicate problems? Not necessarily, but it warrants further analysis of the company's cash flow and other financial conditions.</p>`} id={101618} />
