The acid-test ratio, commonly known as the quick ratio, uses data from a firm's balance sheet to indicate whether it has the means to cover its short-term liabilities. Generally, a ratio of 1.0 or more indicates a company can pay its short-term obligations, while a ratio of less than 1.0 indicates it might struggle to pay them.
