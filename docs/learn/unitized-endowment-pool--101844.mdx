A unitized endowment pool (UEP) is a form of endowment investing that allows multiple endowments to invest in the same pool of assets. Each endowment owns individual units in a UEP and investors generally see their returns monthly. New endowments entering the pool can buy in by receiving units in the pool valued as of a specific buy-in date.
