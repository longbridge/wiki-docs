<p>The Non-Performing Loan Ratio (NPL Ratio) is a financial metric used to assess the quality of a bank’s loan portfolio. It is calculated as the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) to the total amount of loans issued by the bank. Non-performing loans are those loans for which the borrower has not made scheduled payments of principal or interest for a specified period, typically 90 days or more.</p><p>The NPL Ratio is a critical indicator of a bank’s asset quality and risk management effectiveness. A higher NPL Ratio suggests that a larger proportion of the bank’s loans are at risk of default, which can negatively impact the bank’s financial health and profitability. Conversely, a lower NPL Ratio indicates better loan performance and lower credit risk.</p>
