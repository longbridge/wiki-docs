This form of financing typically includes issuing bonds, taking out loans, or other forms of borrowing.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Debt Financing</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Debt financing refers to the method by which businesses or individuals raise funds through borrowing. This type of financing typically includes issuing bonds, taking out loans, or other forms of borrowing. Through debt financing, the borrower commits to repaying the principal and paying interest at a specified future date. The advantage of debt financing is that the borrower can obtain funds without diluting existing shareholders' equity, but the downside is that it increases financial burden and repayment pressure. Debt financing is widely used for business expansion, project investment, and working capital needs.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The history of debt financing can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where merchants and governments borrowed funds to finance trade and public projects. With the development of financial markets, the forms and instruments of debt financing have continuously evolved. In the 19th century, the establishment of modern banking systems and bond markets made debt financing a crucial means for businesses and governments to raise funds.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Debt financing mainly falls into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Bank Loans:</strong> This is the most common form of debt financing, where businesses or individuals borrow from banks and repay the principal and interest within an agreed period. The advantage of bank loans is high flexibility, but the interest rates may be higher.</li><li><strong>Bond Issuance:</strong> Businesses or governments issue bonds to the public to borrow funds, and bondholders receive the principal and interest upon maturity. The advantage of bond issuance is the ability to raise large amounts of funds, but the issuance cost is higher.</li><li><strong>Commercial Paper:</strong> This is a short-term financing tool typically used to meet the short-term funding needs of businesses.
