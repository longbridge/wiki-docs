The Gordon growth model (GGM) is a formula used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that grow at a constant rate. It is a popular and straightforward variant of the dividend discount model (DDM). The GGM assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate in perpetuity and solves for the present value of the infinite series of future dividends.Because the model assumes a constant growth rate, it is generally only used for companies with stable growth rates in dividends per share.
