The Gordon growth model (GGM) is a formula used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that grow at a constant rate. It is a popular and straightforward variant of the dividend discount model (DDM). The GGM assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate in perpetuity and solves for the present value of the infinite series of future dividends.Because the model assumes a constant growth rate, it is generally only used for companies with stable growth rates in dividends per share.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Gordon Growth Model</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The Gordon Growth Model (GGM) is a formula used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a series of future dividends that grow at a constant rate. It is a popular and straightforward variant of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM). GGM assumes that dividends grow at a perpetual constant rate and solves for the present value of an infinite series of future dividends. Due to its assumption of a constant growth rate, it is typically used for companies with stable dividend growth rates.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The Gordon Growth Model was proposed by American economist Myron J. Gordon in the 1950s. The model was introduced to simplify the stock valuation process, especially for companies with stable dividend growth. Gordon's research provided a more concise and practical variant of the Dividend Discount Model.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The Gordon Growth Model has the following key characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Constant Growth Rate:</strong> Assumes that dividends grow at a fixed percentage rate perpetually.</li><li><strong>Applicability:</strong> Suitable for companies with stable and predictable dividend growth rates.</li><li><strong>Simplicity of Formula:</strong> The formula is: <code>P = D / (r - g)</code>, where <code>P</code> is the stock price, <code>D</code> is the next period's dividend, <code>r</code> is the required rate of return, and <code>g</code> is the dividend growth rate.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose a company currently pays a dividend of $2 per share, with an expected dividend growth rate of 5% and a required rate of return of 10%. According to the Gordon Growth Model, the intrinsic value of the stock is: <code>P = 2 / (0.10 - 0.05) = $40</code>.</p><p>Case 2: Another company currently pays a dividend of $3 per share, with an expected dividend growth rate of 4% and a required rate of return of 8%. According to the Gordon Growth Model, the intrinsic value of the stock is: <code>P = 3 / (0.08 - 0.04) = $75</code>.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: What is the main limitation of the Gordon Growth Model?</strong><br/>The main limitation of the Gordon Growth Model is its assumption of a constant dividend growth rate, which may not always hold true in practice. The model may not be suitable for companies with unstable dividend growth.</p><p><strong>Q2: How to handle negative growth rates?</strong><br/>If the dividend growth rate is negative, the model can still be used, but caution is needed as a negative growth rate may indicate financial difficulties for the company.</p>`} id={101919} />
