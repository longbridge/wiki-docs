Regulatory capture is an economic theory that says regulatory agencies may come to be dominated by the industries or interests theyÂ are charged with regulating. The result is that an agency, charged with acting in the public interest, instead acts in ways that benefit incumbent firms in the industry it is supposed to be regulating.
