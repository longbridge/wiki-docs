Depreciation of fixed assets refers to the decrease in value of fixed assets during their use. Fixed assets gradually depreciate over time, use, and wear and tear, and depreciation is the measure and recording of this decrease in value. Depreciation of fixed assets is usually calculated on an annual or accounting period basis to reflect the consumption of economic benefits of fixed assets during their use.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Fixed asset depreciation refers to the reduction in value of fixed assets over time due to usage and wear and tear. It is a measure and record of this value decrease, typically calculated annually or per accounting period, to reflect the consumption of economic benefits of the asset during its use.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of fixed asset depreciation originated with the development of accounting, dating back to the Industrial Revolution. At that time, businesses needed a method to record and reflect the value loss of fixed assets like machinery. As accounting standards evolved, fixed asset depreciation became a crucial part of financial statements.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Fixed asset depreciation is mainly categorized into the straight-line method, accelerated depreciation methods, and units of production method. The straight-line method is the simplest and most commonly used, with equal depreciation amounts each year. Accelerated methods, like the double declining balance method, have higher depreciation in the early years, suitable for assets with rapid technological obsolescence. The units of production method calculates depreciation based on actual usage, ideal for production equipment. Each method has its application scenarios and pros and cons.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A manufacturing company uses the straight-line method for its production equipment. The equipment's original value is 1 million yuan, with a 10-year lifespan and a residual value of 100,000 yuan. The annual depreciation is (1,000,000-100,000)/10=90,000 yuan. Case 2: A tech company uses the double declining balance method for its computer equipment. The equipment's original value is 500,000 yuan, with a 5-year lifespan. The first-year depreciation is 500,000*2/5=200,000 yuan, decreasing annually thereafter.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues include how to choose the appropriate depreciation method and the impact of depreciation on financial statements. When selecting a method, consider the asset's usage and the company's financial strategy. Depreciation affects a company's profit and taxes, so it must be handled carefully.</p>`} id={75} />
