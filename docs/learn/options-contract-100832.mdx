An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction on an underlying security at a preset price, referred to as the strike price, prior to or on the expiration date.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Option Contract</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>An option contract is a financial instrument that allows the parties to agree on a potential transaction at a preset price (strike price) before or on the expiration date. The option contract gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specific price within a specific time period.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The history of options can be traced back to ancient Greece, where the philosopher Thales used option contracts to reserve the use of olive presses. The modern options market began with the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973, the world's first market dedicated to trading standardized option contracts.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Option contracts are mainly divided into two types: call options and put options.</p><ul><li><strong>Call Option:</strong> Gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date. Suitable for investors who expect the price of the underlying asset to rise.</li><li><strong>Put Option:</strong> Gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date. Suitable for investors who expect the price of the underlying asset to fall.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose Investor A buys a call option for Apple Inc. stock with a strike price of $150 and an expiration date three months later. If Apple's stock price rises to $160 on the expiration date, A can buy the stock at $150, making a profit of $10 (excluding the option premium).</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Suppose Investor B buys a put option for Tesla Inc. stock with a strike price of $700 and an expiration date two months later. If Tesla's stock price falls to $650 on the expiration date, B can sell the stock at $700, making a profit of $50 (excluding the option premium).</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>1. What is the difference between an option contract and a futures contract?</strong><br/>An option contract gives the buyer the right but not the obligation, while a futures contract obligates both parties to buy and sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on a future date.</p><p><strong>2. What are the risks of option contracts?</strong><br/>The maximum risk for the option buyer is the premium paid, while the risk for the option seller can be unlimited, depending on the price movement of the underlying asset.</p>`} id={100832} />
