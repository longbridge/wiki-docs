<AIContent content={`<h2>Time Deposit</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A time deposit is a type of bank deposit product where customers deposit a certain amount of money into the bank and cannot withdraw it for a specified period. Time deposits usually have fixed interest rates and deposit terms, and early withdrawal may incur a penalty fee.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of time deposits can be traced back to the 19th century when banks began offering fixed-term and fixed-rate deposit products to attract more deposits. This method of deposit became widely popular in the early 20th century, becoming a significant means for banks to attract deposits.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Time deposits can be categorized based on the deposit term into short-term time deposits (e.g., 3 months, 6 months) and long-term time deposits (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 5 years). Short-term time deposits have higher liquidity but lower interest rates, while long-term time deposits offer higher interest rates but lower liquidity.</p><p>The main characteristics of time deposits include fixed interest rates, fixed terms, and penalties for early withdrawal. Fixed interest rates provide stable returns during the deposit period, while fixed terms require depositors not to withdraw funds before maturity, or they will incur penalties.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Xiao Ming deposits 100,000 yuan into the bank, choosing a one-year time deposit with an annual interest rate of 3%. After one year, Xiao Ming can earn 3,000 yuan in interest, totaling 103,000 yuan.</p><p>Case 2: Xiao Hong deposits 50,000 yuan into the bank, choosing a three-month time deposit with an annual interest rate of 2%. After three months, Xiao Hong can earn 250 yuan in interest, totaling 50,250 yuan.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1.
