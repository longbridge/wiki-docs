In financial terms, the float is money within the banking system that is briefly counted twice due to time gaps in registering a deposit or withdrawal. These time gaps are usually due to the delay in processing paper checks. A bank credits a customer’s account as soon as a check is deposited. However, it takes some time to receive a check from the payer’s bank and record it. Until the check clears the account it is drawn on, the amount it is written for "exists" in two different places, appearing in the accounts of both the recipient’s and payer’s banks.
