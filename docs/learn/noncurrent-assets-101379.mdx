Noncurrent assets are a company's long-term investments for which the full value will not be realized within the accounting year. They are typically highly illiquid, meaning these assets cannot easily be converted into cash. Examples of noncurrent assets include investments, intellectual property, real estate, and equipment. Noncurrent assets appear on a company's balance sheet.
