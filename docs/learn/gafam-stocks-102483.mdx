GAFAM is an acronym for five popular U.S. tech stocks: Google (Alphabet), Apple, Facebook (Meta), Amazon, and Microsoft. GAFAM is quite close to, but nonetheless different than, the more popular FAANG acronym which collectively indicates U.S. technology stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. In the latter, Netflix takes the place of Microsoft.
