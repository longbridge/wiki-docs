Issued shares are the subset of authorized shares that have been sold to and held by the shareholders of a company, regardless of whether they are insiders, institutional investors, or the general public (as shown in the company’s annual report). Issued shares include the stock a company sells publicly to generate capital and the stock given to insiders as part of their compensation packages.Thus, authorized shares are the total amount a company can ever issue or sell, and issued shares are the portion of authorized shares that a company has sold or otherwise placed in the market, including shares they hold in their treasury.Issued shares also differ from outstanding shares, or the number of shares that are in the market and available for purchase by investors but do not include shares the company holds in its treasury. Issued shares may be contrasted with unissued shares, which have been authorized for future offering but have not been issued yet.
