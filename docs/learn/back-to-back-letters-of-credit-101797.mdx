Back-to-back letters of credit are two letters of credit (LoCs) used together to finance a transaction. These are used primarily in international transactions. The first letter of credit serves as collateral for the second letter of credit. Back-to-back letters of credit are usually used in a transaction involving an intermediary between the buyer and seller, such as a broker.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Back-to-Back Letter of Credit</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A back-to-back letter of credit (LC) involves using two LCs together to finance a transaction. This is mainly used in international trade. The first LC serves as collateral for the second LC. Back-to-back LCs are typically used in transactions involving intermediaries between the buyer and seller, such as brokers.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of back-to-back LCs originated in the early 20th century, as international trade rapidly expanded.

After the German company ships the goods, the Hong Kong company receives and transfers them to the Chinese company, completing the transaction.</p><p>Case 2: A US retailer (buyer) needs to procure textiles from India through a UK procurement agent (intermediary). The US retailer issues a master LC to the UK agent, who then issues a slave LC to the Indian supplier. After the Indian supplier ships the goods, the UK agent receives and transfers them to the US retailer, successfully completing the transaction.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1.
