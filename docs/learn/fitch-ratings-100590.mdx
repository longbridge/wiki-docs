Fitch Ratings is an international credit rating agency based in New York City and London. Investors use the company's ratings to determine which investments are less likely to default and yield a solid return. Fitch bases the ratings on several factors, such as what kind of debt a company holds and its sensitivity to systemic changes like interest rates.
