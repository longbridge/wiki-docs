Retained earnings are the cumulative net earnings or profits of a company after accounting for dividend payments. As an important concept in accounting, the word “retained” captures the fact that because those earnings were not paid out to shareholders as dividends, they were instead retained by the company.For this reason, retained earnings decrease when a company either loses money or pays dividends and increase when new profits are created.
