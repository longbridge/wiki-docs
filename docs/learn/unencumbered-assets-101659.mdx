Unencumbered refers to an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims orÂ liens. An unencumbered asset is much easier to sell or transfer than one with an encumbrance. Examples of common unencumbered assets are houses free from mortgages and other liens, cars with paid off loans/notes, or stocks purchased in a cash account.
