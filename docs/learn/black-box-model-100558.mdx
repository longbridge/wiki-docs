In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a device, system, or object which produces useful information without revealing any information about its internal workings. The explanations for its conclusions remain opaque or “black.”Financial analysts, hedge fund managers, and investors may use software that is based on a black-box model in order to transform data into a useful investment strategy.Advances in computing power, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities are causing a proliferation of black box models in many professions, and are adding to the mystique surrounding them.Black box models are eyed warily by potential users in many professions. As one physician writes in a paper about their uses in cardiology: "Black box is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans."
