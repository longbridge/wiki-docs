A knock-out option is an option with a built-in mechanism to expire worthless if a specified price level in the underlying asset is reached. A knock-out option sets a cap on the level an option can reach in the holder's favor.As knock-out options limit the profit potential for the option buyer, they can be purchased for a smaller premium than an equivalent option without a knock-out stipulation.A knock-out can be compared with a knock-in option.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A knock-out option is a type of option with a built-in mechanism that automatically expires if the underlying asset reaches a specified price level. Knock-out options set an upper limit, restricting the level the option can reach in favor of the holder. Because knock-out options limit the profit potential for the option buyer, they can be purchased at a lower premium compared to equivalent options without the knock-out provision. Knock-out options are contrasted with knock-in options.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Knock-out options originated in the financial innovation period of the 1980s when financial markets began introducing various complex derivative instruments to meet the diverse needs of investors. As financial markets evolved, knock-out options gradually became a common risk management tool.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Knock-out options are mainly divided into two categories: up-and-out options and down-and-out options. An up-and-out option expires if the underlying asset price reaches or exceeds a predetermined upper limit, while a down-and-out option expires if the underlying asset price falls to or below a predetermined lower limit. The main characteristics of knock-out options include: 1. Limited profit potential: Due to the knock-out mechanism, the potential profit for the option holder is restricted. 2. Lower premium: Because the profit potential is limited, knock-out options typically have a lower purchase cost compared to regular options. 3. Risk management tool: Knock-out options can help investors lock in risk at specific price levels.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose an investor buys an up-and-out option with an underlying asset of a company's stock and a knock-out price of $100. If the stock price reaches or exceeds $100 before the option's expiration, the option will automatically expire, and the investor will not benefit from any further increase in the stock price. Case 2: Another investor buys a down-and-out option with an underlying asset of a company's stock and a knock-out price of $50. If the stock price falls to or below $50 before the option's expiration, the option will automatically expire, and the investor will not benefit from any further decrease in the stock price.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why choose knock-out options over regular options? Knock-out options have a lower premium, making them suitable for investors looking to reduce costs. 2. What is the main risk of knock-out options? The main risk is that if the underlying asset price reaches the knock-out level, the option will expire, and the investor may lose potential profits.</p>`} id={100843} />
