<p>Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated as a company's net income divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. Calculated as follows: EPS = Net Income / Outstanding Shares</p><p>Earnings per share (EPS) is one of the criteria for judging a company's profitability. If the value is higher year by year, it means that the company is making more money year by year.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Earnings Per Share (EPS) refers to the portion of a company's net profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. The formula for calculating EPS is: EPS = Net Profit / Total Shares Outstanding. EPS is one of the standards for assessing a company's profitability. If the value increases year by year, it indicates that the company is becoming more profitable over time.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of EPS originated in the early 20th century as the stock market developed. Investors needed a simple metric to measure a company's profitability. The earliest methods for calculating EPS were relatively straightforward. As accounting standards and financial reporting became more standardized, the calculation of EPS also became more precise.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> EPS can be divided into Basic EPS and Diluted EPS. Basic EPS is calculated without considering potential dilution factors, while Diluted EPS takes into account all possible dilution factors such as convertible bonds and stock options. Basic EPS is simpler and more direct, whereas Diluted EPS provides a more comprehensive view of a company's profitability under all potential dilution scenarios.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company has a net profit of 100 million yuan in 2023 and 50 million shares outstanding. Its EPS is 100 million yuan / 50 million shares = 2 yuan. Case 2: Another company has a net profit of 50 million yuan in 2023 and 25 million shares outstanding, but it also has 1 million convertible bonds. If all are converted to common stock, the diluted shares outstanding would be 26 million, and the diluted EPS would be 50 million yuan / 26 million shares = 1.92 yuan.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> Investors may encounter the following issues when applying EPS: 1. How to handle changes in the company's share capital affecting EPS? 2. How to understand Diluted EPS? 3. Does EPS fully reflect a company's profitability? Answers: 1. Adjust the calculation formula to account for changes in share capital to ensure accuracy. 2. Diluted EPS considers potential dilution factors, providing a more realistic view of the company's profitability. 3. While EPS is an important metric, it should not be used in isolation and should be combined with other financial indicators for a comprehensive analysis.</p>`} id={200002} />
