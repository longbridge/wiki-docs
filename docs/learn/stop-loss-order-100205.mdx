A stop-loss order is a type of order used by traders to limit their loss or lock in a profit on an existing position. Traders can control their exposure to risk by placing a stop-loss order.Stop-loss orders are orders with instructions to close out a position by buying or selling a security at the market when it reaches a certain price known as the stop price.They are different from stop-limit orders, which are orders to buy or sell at a specific price once the security's price reaches a certain stop price. Stop-limit orders may not get executed whereas a stop-loss order will always be executed (assuming there are buyers and sellers for the security).For example, a trader may buy a stock and place a stop-loss order with a stop 10% below the stock's purchase price. Should the stock price drop to that 10% level, the stop-loss order is triggered and the stock would be sold at the best available price.Although most investors associate a stop-loss order with a long position, it can also protect a short position. In such a case, the position gets closed out through an offsetting purchase if the security trades at or above a specific price.
