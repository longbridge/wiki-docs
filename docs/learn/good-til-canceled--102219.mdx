Good ’til canceled (GTC) describes a type of order that an investor may place to buy or sell a security that remains active until either the order is filled or the investor cancels it. Brokerages will typically limit the maximum time you can keep a GTC order open (active) to 90 days.A GTC order may be contrasted with an immediate or cancel (IOC) order.
