The term use and occupancy (U&O) refers to a real estate agreement between two parties that allows one party to use and/or occupy a property before ownership is transferred from one side to the other. A U&O provides some security if and when complications arise due to financing problems or when there are delays in the closing process. Some governments require U&Os whenever properties are sold to secure the rights of all parties involved.
