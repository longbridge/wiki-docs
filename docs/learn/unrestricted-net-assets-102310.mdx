Unrestricted net assets are donations to nonprofit organizations that have no strings attached. That is, the assets may be used by the organization for general expenses or any legitimate expenditure.Most donations are unrestricted net assets. However, a donor may choose to classify the donation as temporarily restricted net assets or even permanently restricted net assets, thus establishing rules for the use of the donation.
