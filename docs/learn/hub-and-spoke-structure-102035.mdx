Hub and spoke structures are used by investment companies to pool assets, cut costs and improve efficiency. Several investment vehicles, each remaining individually managed, combine their assets and contributing to one central vehicle. This can also be called a master-feeder structure.All of the funds in the system typically have the same investment objective and portfolio manager, or master fund that serves as the "hub". The smaller investment vehicles, or feeder funds, are referred to as the "spokes."

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The hub and spoke structure is an organizational framework used by investment companies to consolidate the assets of multiple independently managed investment vehicles into a central master fund, aiming to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. These independent investment vehicles, known as sub-funds or 'spokes,' typically share the same investment objectives and portfolio managers as the master fund.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The hub and spoke structure originated in the late 20th century as the investment management industry evolved. Investment companies began seeking more efficient ways to manage assets. This structure allows companies to better diversify risk while reducing management costs.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The hub and spoke structure mainly falls into two categories: fully integrated and partially integrated. In the fully integrated model, all sub-fund assets are merged into the master fund. In the partially integrated model, sub-funds retain some independence but still share resources with the master fund. The fully integrated model's advantages include lower management costs and more efficient resource utilization, while the partially integrated model maintains some independence while benefiting from the master fund's economies of scale.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> 1. A large investment company adopts the hub and spoke structure by consolidating multiple sector funds (e.g., technology fund, healthcare fund) into a central master fund. This approach reduces management costs and better diversifies investment risk. 2. Another investment company uses a partially integrated structure, maintaining the independence of each sub-fund while aligning investment strategies and resource sharing with the master fund, thus achieving efficient resource utilization.</p><p><strong>Common Issues:</strong> 1. Investors may worry about the independence of sub-funds, fearing that decisions made by the master fund could impact the performance of sub-funds. 2. Another common issue is the transparency of the fee structure; investors need to clearly understand the fee allocation between the master fund and sub-funds.</p>`} id={102035} />
