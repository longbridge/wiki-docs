Hub and spoke structures are used by investment companies to pool assets, cut costs and improve efficiency. Several investment vehicles, each remaining individually managed, combine their assets and contributing to one central vehicle. This can also be called a master-feeder structure.All of the funds in the system typically have the same investment objective and portfolio manager, or master fund that serves as the "hub". The smaller investment vehicles, or feeder funds, are referred to as the "spokes."
