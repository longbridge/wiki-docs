The impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents refers to the influence of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on the value of cash and cash equivalents held by a company. If the cash and cash equivalents held by a company are denominated in a foreign currency, their value will fluctuate when the exchange rate changes. The appreciation or depreciation of the exchange rate will affect an enterprise's cash flow, financial statements, and operational performance.
