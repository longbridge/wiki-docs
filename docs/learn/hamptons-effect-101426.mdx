The Hamptons Effect refers to a dip in trading that occurs just before the Labor Day weekend that is followed by increased trading volume as traders and investors return from the long weekend. The term references the idea that many of the large-scale traders on Wall Street spend the last days of summer in the Hamptons, a traditional summer destination for the New York City elite.The increased trading volume of the Hamptons Effect can be positive if it takes the form of a rally as portfolio managers place trades to firm up overall returns toward the end of the year. Alternatively, the effect can be negative if portfolio managers decide to take profits rather than opening or adding to their positions. The Hamptons Effect is a calendar effect based on a combination of statistical analysis and anecdotal evidence.
