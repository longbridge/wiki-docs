The Order Protection Rule is one of the four main provisions of the Regulation National Market System (NMS). The rule is meant to ensure that investors receive an execution price that is equivalent to what is being quoted on any other exchangeÂ where the security is traded. The rule eliminates the possibility of orders being traded through, which means executed at a suboptimal price.
