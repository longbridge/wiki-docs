<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(0,0,0,0.05)",color:"rgb(36,41,47)"}}>The Back-End Ratio refers to the percentage of a person's monthly gross income that goes towards paying all of their debts. This ratio includes housing expenses (such as mortgage, insurance, and taxes) as well as other debts (such as credit cards, car loans, student loans, etc.). The Back-End Ratio is a key metric used by lenders to assess a borrower's ability to repay a loan. Generally, a lower Back-End Ratio indicates a stronger ability to manage debt, making lenders more willing to extend credit. Typically, lenders prefer a Back-End Ratio that does not exceed 36% to 43%, depending on the type of loan and the lender's policies.</span></p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Debt Ratio is the ratio of an entity's total debt to its total assets. It reflects the extent to which an entity is financed by debt and is commonly used to measure financial risk.
