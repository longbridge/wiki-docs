The back-end ratio, also known as the debt-to-income ratio, is a ratio that indicates what portion of a person's monthly income goes toward paying debts. Total monthly debt includes expenses, such as mortgage payments (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance), credit card payments, child support, and other loan payments.Lenders use this ratio in conjunction with the front-end ratio to approve mortgages. The lower your back-end ratio, the lower risk you are.
