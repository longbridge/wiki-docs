"Unskilled labor" is an outdated term, once used to describe a segment of the workforce associated with a limited skill set or minimal economic value for the work performed. The correct term is low-wage labor.According to the Center for Global Development the term unskilled and skilled were derived from institutions, politicians, and other interest groups based on the classifications a determination has been made as to who is and is not powerful in the labor market. Also, the idea that the unskilled labor force is characterized by lower educational attainment such as a high school diploma, GED, or lack thereofÂ which typically results in lower wages, is also outdated.Once characterized by lower educational attainment, such as a high school diploma, GED, or lack thereof, it was assumed unskilled laborers made less money. However, in the 21st century, there are jobs for high school graduates or those without a college degree.
