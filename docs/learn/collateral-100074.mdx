Collateral in the financial world is a valuable asset that a borrower pledges as security for a loan.For example, when a homebuyer obtains a mortgage, the home serves as the collateral for the loan. For a car loan, the vehicle is the collateral. A business that obtains financing from a bank may pledge valuable equipment or real estate owned by the business as collateral for the loan. In the event of a default, the lender can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup the loss.Other nonspecific personal loans can be collateralized by other assets. For instance, a secured credit card may be secured by a cash deposit for the same amount of the credit limitâ€”$500 for a $500 credit limit.
