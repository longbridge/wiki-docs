A junior accountantÂ maintains and compiles financial reports and statements in compliance with government regulations and requirements. The junior accountant may analyze balance sheets, manage general ledger accounts, update financial statements, maintain accounts receivable and accounts payable, pay monthly payroll, and prepare financial reports. Accountants, auditors, and junior auditors typically work full-time. Overtime hours may be required during tax season or at the end of the fiscal year.
