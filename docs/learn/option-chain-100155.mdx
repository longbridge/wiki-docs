An options chain, also known as an options matrix, is a listing of all available options contracts for a given security. It shows all listed puts, calls, their expiration, strike prices,Â and volume and pricing information for a single underlying asset within a given maturity period. The chain will typically be categorized by expiration date and segmented by calls vs. puts.An options chain provides detailed quote and price information and should not be confused with an options series or cycle, which instead simply denotes the available strike prices or expiration dates.
