A non-cash charge is a write-down or accounting expense that does not involve a cash payment. They can represent meaningful changes to a company's financial standing, weighing on earnings without affecting short-term capital in any way. Depreciation, amortization, depletion, stock-based compensation, and asset impairments are common non-cash charges that reduce earnings but not cash flows.
