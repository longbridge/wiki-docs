The opening cross is a method the NasdaqÂ uses to determine the opening price for an individual share of the stocks that trade on its exchange. This method accumulates data on the buy and sell interest among market participants for a particular security two minutes before the market opens. The Nasdaq makes this information available to all investors.According to Nasdaq, the opening and closing cross processes give all investors access to the same information, and ensures their orders get the same treatment. This brings fairness and transparency into the marketplace. It also efficiently matches buyers and sellers to ensure market liquidity (that is, the ability for investors to find ready purchasers if they need to sell their positions quickly).
