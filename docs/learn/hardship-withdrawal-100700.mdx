A hardship withdrawal is an emergency removal of funds from a retirement plan, sought in response to what the IRS terms "an immediate and heavy financial need." This type of special distribution may be allowed without penalty from such plans as a traditional IRA or a 401k, provided the withdrawal meets certain criteria regarding the need for the funds and their amount.However, even if penalties are waived (notably, the 10% penalty for withdrawals made before age 59Â½), the withdrawal will still be subject to standard income tax.
