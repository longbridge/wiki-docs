The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical analysis indicator used on intraday charts that resets at the start of every new trading session.It's a trading benchmark that represents the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.VWAP is important because it provides traders with pricing insight into both the trend and value of a security.
