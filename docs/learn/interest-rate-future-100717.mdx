An interest rate future is a futures contract with an underlying instrument that pays interest. The contract is an agreement between the buyer and seller for the future delivery of any interest-bearing asset.The interest rate futures contract allows the buyer and seller to lock in the price of the interest-bearing asset for a future date.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Interest rate futures are financial derivatives based on futures contracts of interest-bearing underlying assets (such as bonds, treasury bills, etc.). Through these contracts, buyers and sellers agree to deliver the interest-bearing asset at a specific price on a future date. The primary function of interest rate futures is to help investors lock in future interest rates and hedge against the risk of interest rate fluctuations.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Interest rate futures originated in the 1970s when the financial market's demand for managing interest rate risk was increasing. In 1975, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) introduced the first interest rate futures contract—the U.S. Treasury bill futures—marking the official birth of the interest rate futures market. Since then, interest rate futures have grown and become an essential risk management tool in the financial markets.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Interest rate futures are mainly divided into short-term interest rate futures and long-term interest rate futures.<ul><li><strong>Short-term interest rate futures:</strong> Typically based on short-term debt instruments, such as 3-month Treasury bills or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). They are characterized by shorter contract durations and higher liquidity, suitable for managing short-term interest rate risks.</li><li><strong>Long-term interest rate futures:</strong> Typically based on long-term debt instruments, such as 10-year Treasury bonds. They are characterized by longer contract durations, suitable for managing long-term interest rate risks.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company expects to borrow a large sum of money within the next year but is concerned that rising interest rates will increase borrowing costs. The company can purchase interest rate futures to lock in the current interest rate, thus hedging against the risk of future interest rate increases.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> An investor holds a large number of long-term bonds and is worried that rising interest rates will cause bond prices to fall. The investor can sell interest rate futures to hedge against interest rate risk and protect the value of their investment portfolio.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between interest rate futures and interest rate swaps?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Interest rate futures are standardized futures contracts traded on futures exchanges, while interest rate swaps are over-the-counter financial instruments where parties agree to exchange future interest payments.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> What are the main risks of interest rate futures?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The main risks include market risk (interest rate fluctuations), liquidity risk (insufficient market depth), and credit risk (counterparty default).</li></ul></p>`} id={100717} />
