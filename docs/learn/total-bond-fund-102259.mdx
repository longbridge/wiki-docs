<p>A Total Bond Fund is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in a diverse range of bond types to provide broad exposure to the bond market. These funds typically include government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and other types of debt instruments. By investing in bonds of different types and maturities, a total bond fund aims to achieve diversification, thereby reducing risk and providing stable income. The most common index used as a benchmark is the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, which captures Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and high-grade mortgage-backed securities.</p>
