Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), also known as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses multiple explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to establish a linear relationship model between the explanatory variables and the response variable. Essentially, multiple regression is an extension of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, as it involves multiple explanatory variables.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of multiple linear regression can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, initially proposed by statisticians such as Karl Pearson and Francis Galton. Their research laid the foundation for modern statistics and regression analysis. With the advancement of computing technology, multiple linear regression became widely applied in the mid-20th century.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Multiple linear regression can be divided into two main categories: simple multiple linear regression and polynomial regression. Simple multiple linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable, while polynomial regression allows for a non-linear relationship. The main characteristics of multiple linear regression include: 1. The ability to handle multiple explanatory variables; 2. Fitting the model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals; 3. Results that are easy to interpret and apply.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: In the real estate market, a multiple linear regression model can be used to predict house prices. Explanatory variables might include house size, age, location, etc. By building the model, one can estimate the impact of these factors on house prices. Case 2: In medical research, multiple linear regression can analyze the impact of various factors (such as age, weight, blood pressure) on the incidence of a certain disease, thereby helping to formulate prevention and treatment strategies.</p><p><strong>Common Issues:</strong> 1. Multicollinearity: When there is a high correlation between explanatory variables, it may affect the stability and interpretability of the model. Solutions include removing highly correlated variables or using regularization techniques. 2. Overfitting: When the model is too complex, it may fit the training data well but perform poorly on new data. Solutions include cross-validation and selecting an appropriate model complexity.</p>`} id={101874} />
