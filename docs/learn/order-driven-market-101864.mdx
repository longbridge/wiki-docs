An order-driven market is a financial market where all buyers and sellers display the prices at which they wish to buy or sell a particular security, as well as the amounts of the security desired to be bought or sold. This kind of trading environment is the opposite of a quote-driven market, whichÂ only displays bids and asks of designated market makers and specialists for the specific security that is being traded.
