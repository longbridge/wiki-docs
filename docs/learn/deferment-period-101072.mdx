The deferment period is a time during which a borrower does not have to pay interest or repay the principal on a loan. The deferment period also refers to the period after the issue of a callable security during which the issuer can not call the security.The duration of a deferment period can vary and is established in advance usually by a contract between the two parties. A student loan deferment, for example, is usually for up to three years, while many municipal bonds have a deferment period of 10 years.
