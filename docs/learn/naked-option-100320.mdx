<p>A Naked Option refers to an options trading strategy where the seller writes (sells) an option contract without holding the underlying asset. This strategy exposes the seller to significant risk because they do not own the asset needed to hedge against potential losses from the option. For instance, selling a naked put option means the seller is obligated to buy the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised, potentially incurring substantial losses if the asset's price falls significantly. Similarly, selling a naked call option obligates the seller to sell the underlying asset at the strike price, which can lead to significant losses if the asset's price rises sharply. Due to the high risk involved, naked option strategies are typically suited for investors with a high risk tolerance and considerable experience in options trading.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Naked options refer to a strategy where an investor sells option contracts without holding the underlying asset. The seller of naked options does not have the corresponding asset to hedge against the potential risks of the option, thus facing higher risks. For example, selling a naked put option means the seller commits to buying the underlying asset at the strike price upon expiration. If the asset's price drops significantly, the seller faces substantial potential losses. Similarly, selling a naked call option means the seller commits to selling the underlying asset at the strike price upon expiration. If the asset's price rises significantly, the seller also faces substantial potential losses. Due to the high risk, naked options strategies are usually suitable for investors with strong risk tolerance and extensive experience.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The history of options trading dates back to ancient Greece, but the modern options market began with the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973.
