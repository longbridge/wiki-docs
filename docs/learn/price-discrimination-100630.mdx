Price discrimination is a selling strategy that charges customers different prices for the same product or service based on what the seller thinks they can get the customer to agree to. In pure price discrimination, the seller charges each customer the maximum price they willÂ pay. In more common forms of price discrimination, the seller places customers in groups based on certain attributes and charges each group a different price.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Price discrimination is a sales strategy where a seller charges different prices for the same product or service based on what the seller believes the customer is willing to agree to. In pure price discrimination, the seller charges each customer the highest price they are willing to pay. In more common forms of price discrimination, the seller groups customers based on specific attributes and charges each group a different price.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of price discrimination was first introduced by economist Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century. As market economies developed, businesses discovered that implementing different pricing strategies for different customer groups could maximize profits. This strategy became widely used in the mid-20th century, especially in the airline, retail, and service industries.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Price discrimination is mainly divided into three categories:<br/>1. <strong>First-degree price discrimination:</strong> Also known as perfect price discrimination, the seller charges each customer the highest price they are willing to pay. This form is rare in practice because it is difficult to accurately determine each customer's willingness to pay.<br/>2. <strong>Second-degree price discrimination:</strong> The seller groups customers based on the quantity or volume of their purchases and charges different prices to different groups. Examples include bulk discounts or volume-based pricing.<br/>3. <strong>Third-degree price discrimination:</strong> The seller groups customers based on specific attributes (such as age, geographic location, occupation, etc.) and charges different prices to different groups. Examples include student discounts and senior citizen discounts.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Airline Ticket Pricing:</strong> Airlines often use price discrimination based on factors such as purchase time, class of service, and customer membership levels. Tickets purchased in advance are usually cheaper, while those bought closer to the departure date are more expensive.<br/>2. <strong>Movie Theater Pricing:</strong> Movie theaters often offer different ticket prices for different age groups (such as students and seniors), which is a common example of third-degree price discrimination.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Is price discrimination legal?</strong> In most cases, price discrimination is legal but must comply with antitrust and fair competition laws.<br/>2. <strong>How does price discrimination affect consumers?</strong> For some consumers, price discrimination may result in lower prices, but for others, it may lead to higher prices.</p>`} id={100630} />
