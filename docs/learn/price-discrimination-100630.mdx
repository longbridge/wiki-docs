Price discrimination is a selling strategy that charges customers different prices for the same product or service based on what the seller thinks they can get the customer to agree to. In pure price discrimination, the seller charges each customer the maximum price they willÂ pay. In more common forms of price discrimination, the seller places customers in groups based on certain attributes and charges each group a different price.
