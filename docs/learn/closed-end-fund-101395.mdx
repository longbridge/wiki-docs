A closed-end fund is a type of mutual fund that issues a fixed number of shares through a single initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital for its initial investments. Its shares can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange but no new shares will be created and no new money will flow into the fund.In contrast, an open-ended fund, such as most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), accepts a constant flow of new investment capital. It issues new shares and buys back its own shares on demand.Many municipal bond funds and some global investment funds are closed-end funds.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A closed-end fund is a type of mutual fund that raises initial investment capital by issuing a fixed number of shares through a single initial public offering (IPO). These shares can be bought and sold on a stock exchange, but no new shares are issued, and no new capital flows into the fund. In contrast, open-end funds, such as most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), accept continuous new investment capital, issue new shares, and redeem their shares as needed.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of closed-end funds originated in the late 19th century in the UK, with one of the earliest closed-end funds being the Foreign & Colonial Government Trust, established in 1868. Over time, this form of fund has been widely adopted globally, particularly in the US and European markets.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Closed-end funds can be categorized based on their investment targets and strategies, such as equity closed-end funds, bond closed-end funds, and hybrid closed-end funds. Their main characteristics include: 1. Fixed number of shares; 2. Listed and traded on stock exchanges; 3. Potential discrepancy between net asset value (NAV) and market price; 4. Relatively stable investment strategies.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. <em>BlackRock Municipal Income Trust</em>: This is a municipal bond closed-end fund that primarily invests in US municipal bonds, providing relatively stable after-tax income. 2. <em>Templeton Dragon Fund</em>: This is a global investment closed-end fund that mainly invests in Asian market equities, aiming to achieve capital appreciation through regional economic growth.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <em>Why does the market price of a closed-end fund differ from its NAV?</em> The market price of a closed-end fund is determined by supply and demand, which may cause it to trade at a premium or discount to its NAV. 2. <em>How is the liquidity of closed-end funds?</em> Closed-end funds are listed and traded on stock exchanges, providing relatively good liquidity, though it may not be as high as that of open-end funds.</p>`} id={101395} />
