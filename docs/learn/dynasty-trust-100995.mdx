A dynasty trust is a long-term trust created to pass wealth from generation to generation without incurring transfer taxes—such as the gift tax, estate tax, or generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT)—for as long as assets remain in the trust.  The dynasty trust's defining characteristic is its duration. If properly designed, it can last for many generations.
