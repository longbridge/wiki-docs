<p>A franchisee is an independent business owner who operates a third-party retail outlet called a franchise. In doing so, the franchisee has purchased the right to use an existing business's trademarks, associated brands, and proprietary knowledge to market and sell the same brand and uphold the same standards as the first business.</p>
