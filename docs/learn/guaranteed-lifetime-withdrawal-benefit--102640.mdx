A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) is a rider to a variable annuity that provides a minimum payout level, even if market losses reduce the cash value of your contract. Most of these riders also allow you to make withdrawals from your cash value as needed. You typically pay for the GLWB rider with annual fees that can vary based on the issuer.
