The theory of price is an economic theory that states that the price for a specific good or service is determined by the relationship between its supply and demand at any given point. Prices should rise if demand exceeds supply and fall if supply exceeds demand.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Price theory is an economic theory that states the price of a specific good or service at any given point in time is determined by its supply and demand relationship. If demand exceeds supply, the price should rise; if supply exceeds demand, the price should fall.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The origin of price theory can be traced back to the 18th-century classical economist Adam Smith, who systematically discussed the mechanism of market price formation in his work 'The Wealth of Nations.' Subsequently, economists like David Ricardo and Alfred Marshall further developed this theory.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Price theory is mainly divided into two categories: micro price theory and macro price theory. Micro price theory focuses on the price formation of individual markets and goods, emphasizing factors such as supply and demand, consumer behavior, and production costs. Macro price theory studies changes in the overall price level in the economy, involving inflation, monetary policy, and aggregate demand. The characteristics of micro price theory are specific and detailed, suitable for analyzing individual markets; macro price theory is broader, suitable for analyzing the entire economic system.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. In a certain city, the housing supply is limited, but due to population growth and urbanization, the demand for housing continues to increase, leading to a continuous rise in house prices. This is a typical case of demand exceeding supply. 2. In a certain agricultural area, there is a bumper harvest of wheat in a particular year, significantly increasing the supply, but the demand remains relatively stable, leading to a decrease in wheat prices. This is a case of supply exceeding demand.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why can't the supply and demand relationship fully explain price changes sometimes? Answer: Price changes may also be influenced by government policies, market expectations, and external shocks. 2. Is price theory applicable to all markets? Answer: Price theory mainly applies to competitive markets; its explanatory power may be limited for monopoly markets or government-regulated markets.</p>`} id={100628} />
