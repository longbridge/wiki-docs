<p>The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a financial theory that posits that in an efficient market, all available information is immediately reflected in securities prices, making it impossible for investors to achieve excess returns through market analysis and prediction. According to this hypothesis, market prices always fully reflect all relevant information, and no investment strategy can systematically outperform the market.</p><p>The main types of the Efficient Market Hypothesis include:</p><p>Weak-Form EMH: Asserts that all past price and volume information is already reflected in current prices, making technical analysis ineffective for achieving excess returns.<br/>Semi-Strong Form EMH: Claims that all publicly available information, including financial statements and news, is already reflected in current prices, making fundamental analysis ineffective for achieving excess returns.<br/>Strong-Form EMH: Argues that all information, including insider information, is already reflected in current prices, making any form of analysis ineffective for achieving excess returns.<br/>Key characteristics of the Efficient Market Hypothesis include:</p><p>Rapid Information Reflection: Market prices quickly adjust to reflect all available information.<br/>Random Walk: Price changes are random and unpredictable, making it impossible to forecast future price movements based on past prices and volumes.<br/>Market Efficiency: Assumes rational market participants and rapid information dissemination, leading to a continuously balanced market.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a financial theory that posits that in an efficient market, all available information is immediately reflected in the prices of securities. Therefore, investors cannot achieve excess returns through analysis and prediction of market trends. According to this hypothesis, market prices always fully reflect all relevant information, making it impossible for any investment strategy to consistently outperform the market.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of the Efficient Market Hypothesis was first introduced by Eugene Fama in the 1960s. He systematically articulated this theory in his 1965 paper and further refined it into three forms—weak, semi-strong, and strong—in his 1970 research. Fama's work laid the foundation for modern financial market theory and garnered widespread attention in both academic and practical circles.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>The Efficient Market Hypothesis is primarily divided into three types:<br/>1. Weak-form EMH: Asserts that all past price and volume information is already reflected in current prices, making technical analysis ineffective for achieving excess returns.<br/>2. Semi-strong-form EMH: Claims that all publicly available financial statements, news, and public information are already reflected in current prices, rendering fundamental analysis ineffective for achieving excess returns.<br/>3. Strong-form EMH: Suggests that all information, including insider information, is already reflected in current prices, making any form of analysis ineffective for achieving excess returns.<br/>The main characteristics of the Efficient Market Hypothesis include:<br/>1. Rapid Information Response: Market prices quickly adjust to reflect all available information.<br/>2. Random Walk: Price changes are random and cannot be predicted based on past prices and volumes.<br/>3. Market Efficiency: Assumes that market participants are rational and information spreads quickly, keeping the market in a state of equilibrium.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. Case One: Suppose a company releases a quarterly report that exceeds expectations. In an efficient market, this information would be immediately reflected in the company's stock price, preventing investors from achieving excess returns by knowing this information in advance.<br/>2. Case Two: An investor attempts to predict stock price trends through technical analysis but finds that their strategy cannot consistently outperform the market over the long term. This validates the weak-form EMH, which states that technical analysis cannot achieve excess returns.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. Question: If the market is efficient, why are there still investment managers and analysts?<br/>Answer: Even if the market is efficient, investment managers and analysts still have value. They can help investors create portfolios that match their risk preferences and provide professional investment advice.<br/>2. Question: Does the Efficient Market Hypothesis mean that the market is always correct?<br/>Answer: The Efficient Market Hypothesis does not mean that the market is always correct; rather, it means that market prices always reflect all currently available information. Market prices may adjust as new information becomes available.</p>`} id={102200} />
