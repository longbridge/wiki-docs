An export credit agency offers trade finance and other services to facilitate domestic companies' international exports. Most countries have ECAs that provide loans, loan guarantees and insurance to help eliminate the uncertainty of exporting to other countries.The purpose of ECAs is to support the domestic economy and employment by helping companies find overseas markets for their products. ECAs can be government agencies, quasi-governmental agencies or even private organizationsâ€”including the arms of commercial financial institutions.
