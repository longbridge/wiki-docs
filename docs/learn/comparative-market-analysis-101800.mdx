A comparative market analysis (CMA) estimates a home's price based on recently sold, similar properties in the immediate area. Real estate agents and brokers create CMA reports to help sellers set listing prices for their homes and help buyers make competitive offers. In addition, you can perform your own comparative market analysis by researching comparable properties (known as "comps") on real estate listing sites, such as realtor.com.
