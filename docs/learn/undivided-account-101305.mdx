<p>An undivided account is a financial or investment arrangement where multiple participants share full responsibility for the entire account, including both assets and liabilities, rather than dividing them proportionally. This means each participant is responsible for the entire account rather than just their individual share. This arrangement is common in securities underwriting, partnerships, or joint investment projects. For example, in securities underwriting, all underwriters in an undivided account collectively assume responsibility for the entire issuance of securities, regardless of the proportion each underwriter subscribes to. The advantage of this arrangement is better risk distribution, but it also requires a high level of trust and cooperation among the participants.</p>
