<p>Operating Income and Operating Earnings usually refer to the same concept, which is operating profit. Both represent the profit remaining after a company deducts its operating costs, excluding non-operating expenses such as interest and taxes.<br/>There might be subtle differences in some cases: Operating Income is a more commonly used term, specifically referring to the income a company generates after deducting operating costs (such as cost of goods sold, administrative expenses, and R&amp;D expenses). It typically excludes non-recurring items and focuses more on the company's core operational activities. Operating Earnings is sometimes used more broadly to describe a company's operational profit, including some non-recurring or one-time revenues and expenses.</p>
