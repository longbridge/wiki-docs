Relative value is a method of determining an asset's worth that takes into account the value of similar assets. This is in contrast with absolute value, which looks only at an asset's intrinsic value and does not compare it to other assets. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a popular valuation method that can be used to measure the relative value of stocks.
