Interest-bearing debt ratio refers to the proportion of interest-bearing debt to total debt. Interest-bearing debt includes loans and bonds that the company needs to pay interest on. The interest-bearing debt ratio reflects the cost and repayment ability of the company's borrowing for financing. A higher interest-bearing debt ratio may indicate that the company faces greater pressure in paying interest, and it also indicates that the company may have higher financial risks.
