<p>A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a savings product offered by banks that provides a fixed interest rate for a specified term. When a depositor invests a certain amount of money in a CD, the bank issues a certificate that promises to pay back the principal along with interest at the end of the term. The term can range from a few months to several years.</p>
