Non-performing loan balance refers to the amount of loans that banks or other financial institutions fail to repay on time. Non-performing loan balance is one of the important indicators of bank risk management, which reflects the quality and repayment ability of bank loan assets.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-performing loan (NPL) balance refers to the amount of loans that have not been repaid on time by borrowers to banks or other financial institutions. This indicator is a crucial part of bank risk management, reflecting the quality of the bank's loan assets and the repayment ability of borrowers.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-performing loans originated during the development of the banking industry. As financial markets matured, banks began to place greater emphasis on loan risk management. In the 1980s, frequent global financial crises prompted banks to systematically monitor and manage non-performing loans to mitigate financial risks.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-performing loans are typically categorized as follows:<ul><li><strong>Overdue Loans:</strong> Loans where the borrower has failed to repay the principal or interest within the stipulated time frame.</li><li><strong>Restructured Loans:</strong> Loans where the bank has modified the terms (such as extending the repayment period or reducing the interest rate) to help the borrower repay the loan and avoid default.</li><li><strong>Bad Debt Loans:</strong> Loans that the bank considers unlikely to be repaid by the borrower, often requiring write-off.</li></ul>Each category has its own characteristics, with overdue loans being the most common type of non-performing loan, while bad debt loans represent the highest risk.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) failed to repay its bank loan on time due to poor business performance, resulting in the loan being classified as overdue. The bank negotiated with the enterprise, extended the repayment period, and reduced the interest rate, eventually enabling the enterprise to repay the loan.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> An individual borrower was unable to repay their mortgage due to unemployment. The bank restructured the loan, extended the repayment period, and temporarily waived some interest. The borrower gradually regained repayment ability after finding a new job.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Q:</strong> What does a high non-performing loan balance indicate?<br/><strong>A:</strong> A high non-performing loan balance typically indicates poor loan quality and insufficient repayment ability of borrowers, which may affect the bank's profitability and stability.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> How do banks handle non-performing loans?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Banks usually handle non-performing loans through restructuring, collection efforts, legal actions, and in severe cases, write-offs.</li></ul></p>`} id={104866} />
