Horizon analysis compares the projected discounted returns of a security or investment portfolioâ€™s total returns over several time frames or investment horizons.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Perspective analysis is the comparison of the expected discounted return rate with the total return of a security or portfolio over several time frames or investment perspectives. It helps investors evaluate investment performance over different periods, enabling more informed investment decisions.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of perspective analysis originated during the development of modern portfolio theory. As investors' understanding of risk and return deepened, analyzing investment performance over different time periods became an important tool. The research of financial scholars like Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe in the mid-20th century laid the theoretical foundation for perspective analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Perspective analysis can be divided into short-term, medium-term, and long-term analysis.<ul><li><strong>Short-term analysis:</strong> Typically refers to investment return analysis within one year, suitable for high-frequency traders and short-term investors.</li><li><strong>Medium-term analysis:</strong> Generally refers to investment return analysis over one to five years, suitable for investors looking for returns in the medium term.</li><li><strong>Long-term analysis:</strong> Refers to investment return analysis over five years or more, suitable for long-term investors such as retirement funds and pension funds.</li></ul>Each type of analysis has its unique application scenarios and advantages and disadvantages. Short-term analysis can quickly respond to market changes but is more volatile; long-term analysis can smooth out short-term fluctuations but requires a longer time to see returns.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> An investor invested in a tech stock at the beginning of 2020 and conducted a short-term perspective analysis at the end of 2021, finding a return rate of 20%. However, through medium-term perspective analysis (2020-2023), the return rate dropped to 15%, possibly due to market volatility and adjustments in tech stocks.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A retirement fund invested in a series of blue-chip stocks in 2010 and conducted a long-term perspective analysis in 2020, finding an average annual return rate of 8%. Through this long-term perspective analysis, fund managers could better evaluate the effectiveness of their investment strategy and make necessary adjustments.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is perspective analysis important for investment decisions?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Perspective analysis helps investors understand investment performance over different periods, enabling more informed decisions and avoiding the impact of short-term volatility on long-term investment strategies.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is perspective analysis applicable to all types of investments?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Perspective analysis is mainly applicable to long-term investments such as stocks, bonds, and portfolios. It may not be as suitable for short-term investments like high-frequency trading.</li></ul></p>`} id={100924} />
