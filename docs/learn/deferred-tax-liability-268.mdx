Deferred income tax liability refers to the income tax that a company calculates according to accounting standards, which is the difference between the taxable income and the confirmed amount by the tax department due to temporary differences, and needs to be paid in the future.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Deferred tax liability refers to the income tax that a company will need to pay in the future due to temporary differences between the taxable income calculated according to accounting standards and the amount confirmed by tax authorities. In simple terms, it represents future tax payments that arise from current accounting treatments.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of deferred tax liability originated from the development of accounting standards, particularly to more accurately reflect a company's financial position and operating results. In the mid-20th century, as corporate accounting standards were gradually improved, the concept of deferred tax liability was introduced to address the differences between accounting profit and taxable profit.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Deferred tax liabilities mainly fall into two categories: one arises when the book value of an asset exceeds its tax base, and the other arises when the book value of a liability is lower than its tax base. The former is typically seen in cases of fixed asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization, while the latter is common in accrued expenses and deferred revenue. Its characteristics include: 1. Reflecting future tax burdens; 2. Arising from temporary differences; 3. Gradually disappearing as time passes and differences reverse.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company purchases equipment with a book value of 1 million yuan. The tax authority allows a depreciation period of 5 years, but accounting standards stipulate a depreciation period of 10 years. Due to slower accounting depreciation, accounting profit is higher than taxable profit in the early years, resulting in a deferred tax liability. Case 2: A company accrues an expense that has been recognized in the books, but the tax authority requires it to be deducted when actually paid. In this case, book profit is lower than taxable profit, also resulting in a deferred tax liability.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why does deferred tax liability arise? It is due to temporary differences caused by discrepancies between accounting standards and tax regulations. 2. Will deferred tax liability always exist? No, it will gradually disappear as time passes and temporary differences reverse.</p>`} id={268} />
