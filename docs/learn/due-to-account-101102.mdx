A due to account is a liability account typically found inside the general ledger that indicates the amount of funds payable to another party. The funds can be currently due or due at a point in the future. This due to account is usually generated and put on the books as the result of a transaction.After a business receives goods or services from an outside party, if the party providing the services is not paid right away, the due to account is created and funds are appropriately allocated to it in order to provide the future payment. The due to account is used in conjunction with a due from account to reconcile from which account the money will be coming, and to which it will be going.The due to account is also called accounts payable.
