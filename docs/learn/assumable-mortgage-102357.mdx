An assumable mortgage is a type of financing arrangement whereby an outstanding mortgage and its terms are transferred from the current owner to a buyer. By assuming the previous owner's remaining debt, the buyer can avoid obtaining their own mortgage. Different types of loans can qualify as assumable mortgages, though there are some special considerations to keep in mind.
