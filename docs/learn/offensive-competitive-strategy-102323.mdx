<p>An Aggressive Competitive Strategy is a proactive approach that a company takes in the marketplace to directly or indirectly undermine its competitors to increase its own market share and competitive advantage. Common tactics include price wars, product innovation, market penetration, aggressive advertising, and mergers and acquisitions. When implementing an aggressive competitive strategy, companies often intensify their marketing efforts, reduce product prices, enhance product quality, or expand their product range to attract more consumers. While this strategy can help a company quickly expand its market share in the short term, it may also involve higher operational risks and costs.</p>
