An offensive competitive strategy is a type of corporate strategy that consists of actively trying to pursue changes within the industry. Companies that go on the offensive generally make acquisitions and invest heavily in research and development (R&D) and technology in an effort to stay ahead of the competition. They will also challenge competitors by cutting off new or under-served markets, or by going head-to-head with them.Defensive competitive strategies, by contrast, are meant to counteract offensive competitive strategies.
