The Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) is the average overnight reference rate for which European banks lend to one another in euros. The EONIA is the interest rate for one-day loans between European banks and is considered an interbank rate. However, European regulatory reforms resulted in the EONIA rate being replaced by the ESTER (Euro Short-Term Rate) effective January 2022.
