The term in-house financing refers to financing that is provided directly to consumers by retailers or other firms. It allows people to purchase and finance goods and services directly from the seller. In-house financing eliminates the firm's reliance on third-party lenders in the financial sector for providing the customer with funds to complete a transaction. It is commonly used in the automotive industry and for large purchases in the retail sector.
