Take or pay is a provision in a contract stating that a buyer has the obligation of either taking delivery of goods from a seller or paying a specified penalty amount to the seller for not taking them. Take-or-pay provisions benefit both parties by sharing risk, and they benefit society by facilitating trade and reducing transactions costs.
