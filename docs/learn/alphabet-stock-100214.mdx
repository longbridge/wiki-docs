An alphabet stock refers to a separate class of common stock that is tied to a specific subsidiary of a corporation. More broadly, it refers to shares of common stock that are distinguished in some way from other common stock of the same company.It is called an alphabet stock because the classification system used to identify each class of common stock uses letters to distinguish it from the parent company's stock. Alphabet stock may have different voting rights from the parent company's stock.
