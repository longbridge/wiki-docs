<p>A Defined-Benefit Plan (DB Plan) is a type of pension plan where an employer promises to pay a specified pension amount to employees upon retirement, based on a predetermined formula. This amount is usually calculated based on factors such as the employee's salary level, years of service, and age. Unlike a Defined-Contribution Plan, where the pension amount depends on investment returns, the pension payments in a Defined-Benefit Plan are predetermined, and the investment risk is borne by the employer.</p><p>Key characteristics include:</p><ol><li><strong>Specified Pension Amount</strong>: The retirement pension amount is determined by a preset formula and is not dependent on investment returns.</li><li><strong>Employer Responsibility</strong>: The employer is responsible for managing the pension fund and bears the investment risk to ensure sufficient funds to pay the promised pension.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Commitment</strong>: The plan typically represents a long-term commitment, covering the employee's entire career until and after retirement.</li><li><strong>Benefit Security</strong>: Provides income security for employees after retirement, offering a high degree of certainty.</li></ol><p>The formula for calculating a Defined-Benefit Plan: The pension payment amount is typically calculated based on the following formula: Pension&nbsp;Amount=Years&nbsp;of&nbsp;Service×Final&nbsp;Salary×Benefit&nbsp;Rate</p><p>For example, if an employee worked for a company for 30 years, with a final salary of $50,000 per year and a benefit rate of 2%, the annual pension amount upon retirement would be: 30×50,000×0.02=$30,000</p><p>Example application: Suppose a company offers a Defined-Benefit Plan as part of its employee benefits. An employee worked at this company for 25 years, and their final salary was $60,000 per year with a benefit rate of 1.5%.
