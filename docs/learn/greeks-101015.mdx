The variables that are used to assess risk in the options market are commonly referred to as "the Greeks." A Greek symbol is used to designate each of these risks.Each Greek variable is a result of an imperfect assumption or relationship of the option with another underlying variable. Traders use different Greek values, such as delta, theta, and others, to assess options risk and manage optionÂ portfolios.
