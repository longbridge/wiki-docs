Convertible bonds are a hybrid financial instrument with characteristics of both bonds and stocks. Such bonds can be converted into common stock under certain conditions. Bondholders can choose to convert the bonds into the company's stock, thereby participating in the company's equity as shareholders, or they can choose to maintain the bondholding rights to receive the interest and principal returns of the bonds.
