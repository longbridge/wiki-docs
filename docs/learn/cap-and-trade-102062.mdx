Cap and trade is a common term for a government regulatory program designed to limit, or cap, the total level of emissions of certain chemicals, particularly carbon dioxide, as a result of industrial activity.Proponents of cap and trade argue that it is a palatable alternative to aÂ carbon tax. Both measures are attempts to reduce environmental damage without causing undue economic hardship to the industry.
