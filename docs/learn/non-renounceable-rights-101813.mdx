<AIContent content={`<h2>Non-Renounceable Rights</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Non-renounceable rights refer to an offer made by a company to its existing shareholders to purchase additional shares, usually at a discounted price. Unlike renounceable rights, non-renounceable rights cannot be transferred or sold.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of non-renounceable rights originated from the need for companies to raise funds, especially when quick capital is required. By offering existing shareholders the opportunity to purchase more shares, companies can ensure a stable source of funding while avoiding dilution of ownership by external investors.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Non-renounceable rights have the following key characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-transferability:</strong> Shareholders cannot transfer or sell these rights to others.</li><li><strong>Discounted Price:</strong> Typically offered at a price lower than the market value to attract shareholder participation.</li><li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> Shareholders must exercise their purchase rights within a specified period, or they will lose the opportunity.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company needs to raise funds for a new project and decides to issue non-renounceable rights to its existing shareholders. Each shareholder can purchase additional shares at 80% of the market price. Due to the attractive discount, most shareholders choose to exercise their rights, and the company successfully raises the required funds.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company, facing financial difficulties, issues non-renounceable rights to raise emergency funds. Although some shareholders are unable to exercise their rights due to lack of funds, the majority participate, helping the company to overcome its financial challenges.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: What happens if I do not exercise my non-renounceable rights?</strong><br/>A1: If you do not exercise your rights, you will miss the opportunity to purchase additional shares at a discounted price, and your ownership percentage may be diluted.</p><p><strong>Q2: Why would a company choose to issue non-renounceable rights instead of renounceable rights?</strong><br/>A2: Issuing non-renounceable rights ensures the participation of existing shareholders, prevents dilution of ownership by external investors, and allows for quick capital raising.</p>`} id={101813} />
