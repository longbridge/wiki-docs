<p>A Leveraged Lease is a type of finance lease in which the lessor (leasing company) borrows funds to purchase equipment or other assets and then leases those assets to a lessee. In this arrangement, the lessor provides only a portion of the funds, typically 20-40% of the asset's value, while the remaining funds are obtained through borrowing.</p>
