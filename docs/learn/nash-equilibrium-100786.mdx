Nash equilibrium is a concept in game theory where the optimal outcome is when there is no incentive for players to deviate from their initial strategy. The players have knowledge of their opponentâ€™s strategy and still will not deviate from their initial chosen strategies because it remains the optimal strategy for each player.Overall, an individual can receive no incremental benefit from changing actions, assuming that other players remain constant in their strategies. A game may have multiple Nash equilibria or none at all.
