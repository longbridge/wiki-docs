Hidden values are assets that are undervalued on a company's balance sheet and therefore may not be incorporated into or reflected in the company's share price.So-called value investors seek to uncover hidden values on a company's balance sheet that are often overlooked by the average investor, often through the use of fundamental analysis. An asset that is marked at book value but actually worth more in terms of its fair market price would be considered a hidden value.
