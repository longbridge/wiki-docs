<p>A qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA) provides a lifetime payment to an annuitant and&nbsp;spouse, child, or dependent from a qualified plan. QJSA rules apply to money-purchase pension plans, defined benefit plans,&nbsp;and target benefits. They can also apply to profit-sharing and 401(k)&nbsp;and 403(b) plans, but only if so elected under the plan.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA) is a type of annuity that provides lifetime payments to the beneficiary of a retirement plan and their spouse, children, or dependents. The purpose of QJSA is to ensure that after the primary beneficiary's death, their spouse or other designated beneficiaries continue to receive annuity payments.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of QJSA originated in the United States' retirement security system, aimed at ensuring continuous financial support for retirees and their families through legislation. The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 formally introduced QJSA provisions, requiring most pension plans to offer this annuity option.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>QJSA primarily applies to the following types of retirement plans:</p><ul><li>Mandatory Purchase Pension Plans: These plans require contributions from both employers and employees to ensure a stable income source after retirement.</li><li>Defined Benefit Plans: These plans predetermine the specific amount to be received after retirement, usually based on years of service and salary levels.</li><li>Target Benefit Plans: Similar to defined benefit plans but more flexible, allowing benefit amounts to be adjusted based on investment performance.</li><li>Profit Sharing Plans and 401(k) and 403(b) Plans: These plans are typically based on employer profits or voluntary employee contributions, but QJSA applies only if the plan includes this option.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Mr. Zhang worked for a large company for 30 years and chose the QJSA option upon retirement. He receives a monthly annuity payment of 3000 yuan. If Mr. Zhang passes away, his spouse, Mrs. Li, will continue to receive 1500 yuan in annuity payments until her death.</p><p>Case 2: Ms. Wang worked for a non-profit organization and participated in a 403(b) plan. She chose the QJSA option and receives a monthly annuity payment of 2000 yuan after retirement. If Ms. Wang passes away, her dependents (such as children) will continue to receive 1000 yuan in annuity payments until they reach adulthood.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q: If I choose QJSA, can I change the beneficiary?</strong><br/>A: Once QJSA is chosen and annuity payments begin, changing the beneficiary is generally not allowed unless under specific circumstances such as the beneficiary's death.</p><p><strong>Q: How is the annuity payment amount for QJSA calculated?</strong><br/>A: The annuity payment amount is typically based on the beneficiary's life expectancy, the account balance at retirement, and the selected payment ratio.</p>`} id={102718} />
