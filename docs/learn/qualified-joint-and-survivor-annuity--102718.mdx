A qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA) provides a lifetime payment to an annuitant and spouse, child, or dependent from a qualified plan. QJSA rules apply to money-purchase pension plans, defined benefit plans, and target benefits. They can also apply to profit-sharing and 401(k) and 403(b) plans, but only if so elected under the plan.
