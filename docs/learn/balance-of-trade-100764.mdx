Balance of trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of a country's exports and the value of a country's imports for aÂ given period. Balance of trade is the largest component of a country's balance of payments (BOP). Sometimes the balance of trade between a country's goods and the balance of trade between its services are distinguished as two separate figures.The balance of trade is also referred to as the trade balance, the international trade balance, the commercial balance, or the net exports.
