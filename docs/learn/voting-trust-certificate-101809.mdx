A voting trust certificate is a document issued by a limited-life trust of a corporation established to give temporary voting control of a corporation to one or a few individuals. A voting trust certificate is issued to a stockholder in exchange for his or her common stock, and represents all of the normal rights of a shareholder (e.g., receiving dividends) except the right to vote. The life of a voting trust certificate in many cases ranges from two to five years, at which point the common stock, with voting rights, is returned to the shareholder.
