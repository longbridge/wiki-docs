Delta is a risk metric that estimates the change in the price of a derivative, such as an options contract, given a $1 change in its underlying security. It is represented by the symbol Î”. The delta also tells options traders the hedging ratio to become delta neutral. A third interpretation of an option's delta is the probability that it will finish in the money. Delta values can be positive or negative depending on the type of option.
