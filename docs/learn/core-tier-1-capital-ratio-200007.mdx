<p style={{marginLeft:"!important"}}>The Core Tier 1 Capital Ratio is a key measure of a bank’s financial strength from a regulator’s point of view. It is the ratio of a bank’s core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets (RWA). Core equity capital primarily includes common shares and retained earnings, which are considered the most reliable and stable form of capital. Risk-weighted assets are the bank’s assets weighted by credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.</p><p style={{marginLeft:"0px"}}>In simple terms, the Core Tier 1 Capital Ratio indicates how well a bank can withstand financial stress and absorb losses. A higher ratio means the bank is more financially stable and has a stronger buffer against potential losses.</p>
