An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction on an underlying security at a preset price, referred to as the strike price, prior to or on the expiration date.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An option agreement is a contract between two parties that grants the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) before or on the expiration date. Option agreements are typically categorized into call options and put options.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of options can be traced back to ancient Greece, but the modern options market began with the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973. The CBOE's creation marked the advent of standardized option contracts and a centralized trading market, making options trading more regulated and transparent.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><ul><li><strong>Call Option:</strong> Grants the holder the right to purchase the underlying security at a specific price before or on the expiration date. Suitable for investors who anticipate a rise in the asset's price.</li><li><strong>Put Option:</strong> Grants the holder the right to sell the underlying security at a specific price before or on the expiration date. Suitable for investors who anticipate a decline in the asset's price.</li></ul><p>Characteristics of option agreements include:<ul><li>Leverage: Options allow investors to control larger assets with a smaller amount of capital.</li><li>Limited Risk: The maximum loss for the buyer is the premium paid for the option.</li><li>Flexibility: Options can be used for hedging, speculation, and income enhancement strategies.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Examples:</strong><ul><li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Suppose Investor A buys a call option on Apple Inc. stock with a strike price of $150 and an expiration date three months later. If Apple's stock price rises to $160 before the expiration date, Investor A can buy the stock at $150, thus making a profit.</li><li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Investor B buys a put option on Tesla Inc. stock with a strike price of $700 and an expiration date two months later.
