Guaranteed payments to partners are payments meant to compensate a partner for services rendered or use of capital. Essentially, they are the equivalent of a salary for partners or limited liability company (LLC) members. These kinds of payments eliminate the risk of a partner making personal contributions of time or property and then never getting compensated if the partnership does not prove to be successful.The word “guaranteed” refers to the fact that these kinds of payments—known as “first-priority distributions”—are made without regard to the partnership’s profitability. In fact, such payments constitute a net loss for the partnership. They can create special and unexpected tax implications if they are not handled correctly. This can prove complicated, especially as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the courts have not agreed at times on what constitutes a guaranteed payment to a partner.
