Interest rate cut is one of the monetary policy measures taken by the central bank, which refers to the reduction of interest rates. Through interest rate cuts, the central bank aims to stimulate economic growth, promote investment and consumption. Interest rate cuts can lower borrowing costs and encourage businesses and individuals to increase borrowing activities, thereby stimulating economic activities. In addition, interest rate cuts can also increase asset prices, increase investment returns, and promote the activity of the capital market.
