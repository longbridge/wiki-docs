Passive activity loss rules are a set of tax regulations that prohibit taxpayers from using passive losses to offset earned or ordinary income.Essentially, the regulations prevent investors from using losses incurred from income-producing activities in which they are not materially involved.Being materially involved with earned or ordinary income-producing activities means the income is active income and may not be reduced by passive losses. Passive losses can be used only to offset passive income.
