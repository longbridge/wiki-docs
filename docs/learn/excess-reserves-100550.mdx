Excess reserves are capital reserves held by a bank or financial institution above amounts required by regulators, creditors, or internal controls. For commercial banks, excess reserves are measured against standard reserve requirement ratios set by central banking authorities. These required reserve ratios set the minimum liquid deposits (such as cash) that must be in reserve at a bank; more is considered excess.Excess reserves may also be known as secondary reserves.
