The weighted average market capitalization refers to a type of stock market index construction that is based on the market capitalization of the index's constituent stocks. Large companies would, therefore, account for a greater portion of an index than smaller stocks. This means the movement of an index would depend on a small set of stocks.The most well-known market capitalization weight index is the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest assets by market capitalization. The top four holdings combine for over 10% of the entire index. These include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta, formerly Facebook, (META). The S&P 500 is widely considered a gauge of the strength of the broader market and a benchmark for performance.
