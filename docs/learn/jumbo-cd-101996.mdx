A jumbo certificate of deposit is a CD that requires a higher minimum balance obligation than that required by traditional CDs. In return, the jumbo CD pays a higher rate of interest. A CD is a type of savings account that pays fixed or variable interest in exchange for depositors leaving their funds in the account until a specified date of maturity.
