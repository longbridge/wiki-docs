The Leadership Grid is a model of behavioral leadership developed in the 1960s by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton. Previously known as the Managerial Grid, the Leadership Grid is based on two behavioral dimensions: concern for production, which is plotted on the X-axis on a scale from one to nine points; and concern for people, which is plotted on a similar scale along the Y-axis.The model identified five leadership styles by their relative positions on the grid. The first number in the examples below reflects a leader's concern for production; the second number is a leader's concern for people.
