"Held by production" is a provision in an oil or natural gas property lease that allows the lessee, generally an energy company, to continue drilling activities on the property as long as it is economically producing a minimum amount of oil or gas. The held-by-production provision thereby extends the lessee's right to operate the property beyond the initial lease term. This provision is also a feature of mineral property leases.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Held by Production Clause</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The 'Held by Production' (HBP) clause is a provision in oil or gas property lease agreements that allows the lessee (usually an energy company) to continue drilling activities on the property as long as it produces a minimum economic amount of oil or gas. This clause extends the lessee's right to operate the property beyond the initial lease term. It is also a characteristic of mineral property leases.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The HBP clause originated in the early 20th century when the oil and gas industry began to rapidly develop. To encourage energy companies to conduct more exploration and production activities within the lease term, this clause was introduced in lease agreements. It ensures that as long as there is minimal production, the lessee can continue to operate the property, thus avoiding frequent contract renewals.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The HBP clause mainly falls into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Strict HBP Clause:</strong> Requires the lessee to continuously produce oil or gas to maintain the lease rights.</li><li><strong>Flexible HBP Clause:</strong> Allows the lessee to retain lease rights during short non-production periods, provided they can justify the reasons.</li></ul><p>Characteristics include:</p><ul><li>Extended Lease Term: The lease agreement can be automatically extended as long as there is minimal production.</li><li>Encourages Continuous Production: Incentivizes the lessee to maintain production activities, preventing resource wastage.</li><li>Reduces Contract Renewals: Lowers administrative costs and complexities associated with frequent contract renewals.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> An energy company leased an oil field in Texas with an initial lease term of 5 years. Through the HBP clause, as long as the company produced at least 1,000 barrels of oil annually, they could continue operating the oil field after the initial lease term. As a result, the company continued production for 20 years beyond the initial term, significantly enhancing the economic value of the oil field.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> In North Dakota, a natural gas company leased a gas field. Due to market fluctuations, the company failed to meet the minimum production requirement in a particular year. However, through a flexible HBP clause, they justified the market reasons and retained the lease rights. The following year, as the market recovered, they resumed production and continued to profit.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> If production stops under an HBP clause, does the lease agreement terminate immediately?<br/><strong>A:</strong> It depends on the specific terms of the clause. Under a strict HBP clause, stopping production may lead to lease termination; under a flexible HBP clause, the lessee may have the opportunity to retain lease rights through reasonable justification.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the HBP clause impact resource management?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The HBP clause encourages continuous production, preventing resource wastage, but it may also lead to overproduction during periods of low resource prices.</p>`} id={101833} />
