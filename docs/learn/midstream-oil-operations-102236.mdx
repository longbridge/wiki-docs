Midstream is a term used to describe one of the three major stages of oil and gas industry operations. Midstream activities include the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.The two other major stages are upstream, which refers to raw crude oil and natural gas production, and downstream, which refers to the refining of crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet, and other fuels. Today, many large oil companies undertake all streams of the process and are known as integrated oil companies.
