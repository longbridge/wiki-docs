<p>Deposit-taking refers to the process by which banks or other financial institutions accept funds from customers in the form of deposits. These deposits can take various forms, such as demand deposits, time deposits, and savings deposits. By taking deposits, financial institutions obtain a source of funds that can be used for lending, investing, and other financial activities.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Deposit absorption refers to the process by which banks or other financial institutions receive funds from customers in the form of deposits. These deposits can take various forms, such as demand deposits, time deposits, and savings deposits. Through deposit absorption, financial institutions obtain a source of funds that can be used for loans, investments, and other financial activities.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of deposit absorption dates back to the origins of banking in ancient times, when goldsmiths and merchants began safeguarding valuables and currency for clients. With the development of modern banking, deposit absorption became a primary method for banks to acquire funds, particularly during the formalization of the banking system in the 19th century.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Deposit absorption is mainly categorized into demand deposits, time deposits, and savings deposits. Demand deposits allow customers to withdraw funds at any time, offering high liquidity but lower interest rates. Time deposits require customers to leave funds untouched for a specified period, usually offering higher interest rates. Savings deposits fall in between, providing some interest while allowing limited withdrawals.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>During the 2008 financial crisis, many banks increased time deposit rates to attract more deposits. For instance, Citibank introduced high-interest time deposit products during the crisis to strengthen its funding base. Another example is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which attracted a large number of personal deposits through innovative savings products, helping it maintain stability amid market turmoil.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often face a trade-off between interest rates and liquidity when choosing deposit types. A common misconception is that all deposit types offer the same level of safety and returns, whereas in reality, different types of deposits vary significantly in terms of interest rates, liquidity, and risk.</p>`} id={69} />
