<p>Economic value added (EVA) is a measure of a company's financial performance based on the residual wealth calculated by deducting its cost of capital from its operating profit, adjusted for taxes on a cash basis. EVA can also be referred to as economic profit, as it attempts to capture the true economic profit of a company. This measure was devised by management consulting firm Stern Value Management, originally incorporated as Stern Stewart &amp; Co.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Economic Value Added (EVA)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Economic Value Added (EVA) is a financial performance metric based on a company's net asset value. It is calculated by subtracting the cost of capital from the operating profit before tax and then adjusting it to a cash basis after-tax amount. EVA aims to capture the true economic profit of a company, hence it is also known as economic profit.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>EVA was conceived by the management consulting firm Stern Value Management, originally known as Stern Stewart & Co. The metric gained popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, becoming an important tool for measuring corporate financial performance.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>EVA has the following key characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>True Reflection of Economic Profit:</strong> By deducting the cost of capital, EVA provides a more accurate reflection of a company's economic profit, not just its accounting profit.</li><li><strong>Focus on Capital Efficiency:</strong> By considering the cost of capital, EVA encourages companies to use capital more efficiently and improve investment returns.</li><li><strong>Long-term Perspective:</strong> EVA emphasizes long-term value creation, discouraging short-term behavior.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company has an operating profit before tax of 5 million yuan in a given year, a capital cost of 2 million yuan, and a tax rate of 30%. The EVA calculation for this company is as follows:</p><p>After-tax operating profit = 5 million yuan × (1 - 30%) = 3.5 million yuan</p><p>EVA = 3.5 million yuan - 2 million yuan = 1.5 million yuan</p><p>The company created an economic value added of 1.5 million yuan in that year.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company has an operating profit before tax of 10 million yuan in a given year, a capital cost of 8 million yuan, and a tax rate of 25%. The EVA calculation for this company is as follows:</p><p>After-tax operating profit = 10 million yuan × (1 - 25%) = 7.5 million yuan</p><p>EVA = 7.5 million yuan - 8 million yuan = -0.5 million yuan</p><p>The company did not create economic value added in that year, instead, it incurred a loss of 0.5 million yuan.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why does EVA reflect a company's economic performance better than net profit?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because EVA takes into account the cost of capital, whereas net profit does not. EVA provides a more accurate reflection of the economic value created for shareholders.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can a company improve its EVA?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A company can improve its EVA by increasing operating profit, reducing the cost of capital, or using capital more efficiently.</p>`} id={101463} />
