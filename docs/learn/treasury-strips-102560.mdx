This investor can purchase the principal component of Treasury STRIPS and receive the full principal at maturity.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Can the interest and principal components of Treasury STRIPS be traded on the secondary market?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the interest and principal components of Treasury STRIPS can be traded independently on the secondary market.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Do investors need to pay taxes on Treasury STRIPS?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, although Treasury STRIPS do not pay periodic interest, investors are still required to pay taxes on the accrued interest each year.</p>`} id={102560} />
