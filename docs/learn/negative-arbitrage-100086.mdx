Negative arbitrage is the opportunity lost when bond issuers assume proceeds from debt offerings and then hold that money in escrow for a period of time (usually in cash or short-term treasury investments) until the money is able to be put to use to fund a project, or to repay investors. Negative arbitrage may occur with a new bond issue or following a debt refinancing.The opportunity cost occurs when the money is reinvested and the debt issuer earns a rate or return that is lower than what must actually be paid back to debt holders.
