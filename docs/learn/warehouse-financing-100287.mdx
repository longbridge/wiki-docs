Warehouse financing is a form of inventory financing that involves a loan made by a financial institution to a company, manufacturer, or processor. Existing inventory, goods, or commodities are transferred to a warehouse and used as collateral for the loan. Warehouse financing is most often used by smaller privately-owned firms, particularly those in commodities-related businesses, that do not have access to other options.Note that warehouse financing is different from warehouse lending, whichÂ is a way for a bank to provide loans without using its own capital.
