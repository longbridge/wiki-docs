<p>Warehouse Financing is a method of obtaining financing by using inventory stored in a warehouse as collateral. Businesses place their inventory in a third-party warehouse and receive warehouse receipts. These receipts can be used as collateral to apply for loans from banks or other financial institutions. Warehouse financing helps businesses obtain working capital without having to immediately sell their inventory, thus supporting their day-to-day operations or business expansion. This type of financing is common in industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and trade.</p>
