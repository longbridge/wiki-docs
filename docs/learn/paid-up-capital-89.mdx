Paid-up capital refers to the amount of capital actually received from shareholders in the shares issued by a joint stock company. Paid-up capital is the basic capital of a joint stock company and represents the actual contribution of shareholders to the company.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Paid-in capital refers to the amount of money that a company has received from shareholders in exchange for shares of stock. It represents the actual investment made by shareholders in the company.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of paid-in capital emerged with the development of joint-stock companies. The earliest joint-stock company, the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century, raised funds by issuing shares, with paid-in capital representing the actual contributions received from shareholders.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Paid-in capital can be categorized into common stock and preferred stock. Common stock represents basic shareholder equity, usually with voting rights and dividend rights. Preferred stock has priority over common stock in dividends and liquidation but typically lacks voting rights. Features of paid-in capital include its stability and impact on the company's capital structure.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: Apple Inc. has increased its paid-in capital through multiple stock issuances to raise funds for research and market expansion. Case 2: Alibaba, during its IPO, raised significant paid-in capital to support its global business expansion.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often confuse paid-in capital with authorized capital. Paid-in capital is the actual funds received by the company, while authorized capital is the maximum number of shares a company can issue. Another common issue is overlooking the impact of paid-in capital on the company's financial stability.</p>`} id={89} />
