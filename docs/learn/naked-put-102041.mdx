The seller in this strategy, known as a naked writer, aims to collect the option's premium by anticipating an increase in the price of the underlying security, without the intention of holding the security in the near term.</span></p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Selling a put option is an options trading strategy where an investor sells a put option without holding a short position in the underlying security. The seller of this strategy is known as a naked option seller. They aim to earn the option premium by predicting that the price of the underlying security will rise, without intending to hold the security in the short term.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The history of options trading dates back to ancient Greece, but the development of the modern options market began with the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973.

This strategy carries lower risk because the investor has sufficient funds to meet the potential purchase.</li><li><strong>Naked Put Selling:</strong> The investor sells a put option without holding enough cash.
