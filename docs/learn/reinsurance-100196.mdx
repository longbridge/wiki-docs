Reinsurance, often referred to as insurance for insurance companies, is a contract between a reinsurer and an insurer. In this contract, the insurance company—known as the ceding party or cedent—transfers some of its insured risk to the reinsurance company. The reinsurance company then assumes all or part of one or more insurance policies issued by the ceding party.
