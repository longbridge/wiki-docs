<p>Contributed Capital, also known as paid-in capital, refers to the funds that shareholders actually contribute to a company. This includes money raised from issuing stock and other forms of shareholder contributions. Contributed capital is reflected in the shareholders' equity section of the company's balance sheet and is typically divided into common stock and additional paid-in capital. Common stock represents funds received at the par value of issued shares, while additional paid-in capital represents funds received above the par value. Contributed capital is a crucial source of funding for a company and reflects the shareholders' investment commitment.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Paid-in Capital</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Paid-in capital refers to the actual funds that shareholders have invested in a company, including funds raised through the issuance of stocks and other forms of shareholder contributions. It is reflected in the shareholders' equity section of the company's financial statements and is typically divided into share capital and capital surplus. Share capital refers to the funds received from issuing stocks at their par value, while capital surplus refers to the funds exceeding the par value. Paid-in capital is a significant source of funding for a company and reflects the shareholders' investment commitment.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of paid-in capital originated with the development of corporate enterprises. With the emergence of joint-stock companies, there was a need to record and reflect the actual contributions of shareholders. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as capital markets developed, the concept of paid-in capital became widely accepted and applied.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Paid-in capital is mainly divided into two parts: share capital and capital surplus. Share capital refers to the funds received by the company from issuing stocks at their par value, reflecting the basic investment of shareholders. Capital surplus refers to the funds exceeding the par value when stocks are issued at a premium, and it usually includes the premium portion of the stock issuance and donated capital. Together, share capital and capital surplus constitute the company's paid-in capital, reflecting the total investment of shareholders in the company.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A company conducts an initial public offering (IPO) and issues 1 million shares with a par value of 1 yuan per share at an issue price of 5 yuan. The company receives 5 million yuan in total, with 1 million yuan recorded as share capital and 4 million yuan recorded as capital surplus.</p><p>Case 2: A company receives donated equipment from a shareholder, with a market value of 500,000 yuan. The value of the equipment is recorded as capital surplus, reflecting the shareholder's additional investment in the company.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. What is the difference between paid-in capital and registered capital?<br/>Paid-in capital is the actual funds invested by shareholders, while registered capital is the amount of capital registered with the business registration authority, usually representing the total amount of capital that shareholders have committed to invest.</p><p>2. Does paid-in capital affect the company's financial condition?<br/>Paid-in capital reflects the shareholders' investment commitment.
