<p>The Equity Capital Markets (ECM) refer to the market where companies raise capital by issuing equity securities, such as common or preferred stocks. These securities can be publicly offered (such as stocks listed on a stock exchange) or privately placed (such as stocks issued to specific investors). The primary function of the ECM is to provide companies with a financing avenue to obtain long-term capital to support business expansion, research and development, new project investments, and debt restructuring.</p><p>The ECM comprises two main segments:</p><p><strong>Primary Market</strong>: This is where companies raise capital by issuing new shares for the first time (Initial Public Offering, IPO) or by issuing additional shares (Follow-on Offering). In the primary market, funds flow directly from investors to the issuing company.</p><p><strong>Secondary Market</strong>: This is where existing shares are traded among investors. These transactions do not directly affect the issuing company's capital structure but the performance in the secondary market can influence the company's future financing capabilities and stock price.</p><p>The key participants in the ECM include companies, investment banks, institutional investors, retail investors, and regulatory authorities. Investment banks play a crucial role in the equity issuance process, providing underwriting, advisory, pricing, and other services.</p>
