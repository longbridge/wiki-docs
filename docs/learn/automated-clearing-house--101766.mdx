The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is an electronic funds-transfer system run by Nacha. The Automated Clearing House traces its roots back to the late 1960s but was officially established in the mid-1970s. The payment system provides many types of ACH transactions, such as payroll deposits. It requires a debit or credit from the originator and a credit or debit on the recipient's end.
