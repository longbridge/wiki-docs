An air waybill (AWB) is a document that accompanies goods shipped by an international air courier to provide detailed information about the shipment and allow it to be tracked. The bill has multiple copies so that each party involved in the shipment can document it. An air waybill (AWB), also known as an air consignment note, is a type of bill of lading. However, an AWB serves a similar function to ocean bills of lading, but an AWB is issued in non-negotiable form, meaning there's less protection with an AWB versus bills of lading.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An Air Waybill (AWB) is a document that accompanies international air freight shipments, providing detailed information about the cargo and allowing it to be tracked. AWBs have multiple copies so that each party involved in the shipment can keep a record. Also known as an air consignment note, an AWB is a type of bill of lading. However, unlike a sea waybill, an AWB is issued in a non-negotiable form, meaning it offers less protection compared to a sea waybill.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The use of air waybills dates back to the early 20th century, becoming more common as air transport developed. Initially, air waybills were designed and used by individual airlines, but later the International Air Transport Association (IATA) standardized the format to facilitate international cargo transport and management.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Air waybills are mainly divided into two categories: Master Air Waybill (MAWB) and House Air Waybill (HAWB).<br/>1. Master Air Waybill (MAWB): Issued by the airline, it applies to the contract of carriage between the airline and the freight forwarder.<br/>2. House Air Waybill (HAWB): Issued by the freight forwarder, it applies to the contract of carriage between the freight forwarder and the shipper.<br/>The main characteristics of an AWB include:<br/>1. Non-negotiability: AWBs cannot be transferred like sea waybills, meaning the ownership of the cargo cannot be changed through the transfer of the document.<br/>2. Multiple copies: AWBs usually have multiple copies for record-keeping and tracking by all parties.<br/>3. Detailed information: AWBs contain detailed information about the cargo, such as weight, volume, and destination.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong><br/>Case 1: An electronics company needs to ship a batch of new smartphones from China to the United States. The company books air freight services through a freight forwarder, who issues a House Air Waybill (HAWB) and hands over the cargo to the airline. The airline issues a Master Air Waybill (MAWB), and the cargo successfully arrives in the U.S. The customer tracks the shipment status in real-time using the tracking number on the AWB.<br/>Case 2: A clothing manufacturer needs to ship a batch of new garments from Italy to Japan. The manufacturer books air freight services through a freight forwarder, who issues a House Air Waybill (HAWB) and hands over the cargo to the airline. The airline issues a Master Air Waybill (MAWB), and the cargo successfully arrives in Japan. The customer tracks the shipment status in real-time using the tracking number on the AWB.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. Why can't AWBs be transferred?<br/>The non-negotiability of AWBs simplifies the management and tracking of air cargo, reducing disputes and complexities.<br/>2. What is the main difference between an AWB and a sea waybill?<br/>AWBs are non-negotiable, whereas sea waybills can be transferred, allowing for a change in cargo ownership. Additionally, AWBs are typically used for air transport, while sea waybills are used for sea transport.</p>`} id={100691} />
