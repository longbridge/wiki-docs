Vertical equity is a method of collecting income tax in which the taxes paid increase with the amount of earned income. The driving principle behind vertical equity is that those who have the ability to pay more taxes should contribute more than those who are not.This can be contrasted with horizontal equity, wherebyÂ individuals with similar income and assets should pay the same amount in taxes.
