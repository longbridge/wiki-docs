<p>Index futures are futures contracts based on stock market indices (such as the S&amp;P 500 Index, Nasdaq 100 Index, Hang Seng Index, etc.) as the underlying assets. Investors buy and sell these contracts to predict the price of the index at a specific point in the future.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Index futures are futures contracts based on stock market indices such as the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Hang Seng Index. Investors buy and sell these contracts to predict the price of the index at a specific future date.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of index futures first appeared in the 1980s. In 1982, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) introduced the first stock index futures contractâ€”the S&P 500 Index futures. This innovation provided investors with a new risk management tool and quickly gained global popularity.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Index futures can be categorized based on different markets and indices, mainly including:<ul><li><strong>Stock Index Futures:</strong> Such as S&P 500 Index futures, NASDAQ-100 Index futures, and Hang Seng Index futures. These contracts are based on specific stock market indices and are suitable for predicting and hedging the overall market trend.</li><li><strong>Sector Index Futures:</strong> Such as Energy Index futures, Technology Index futures, etc. These contracts are based on specific sector indices and are suitable for predicting and hedging the market trend of specific sectors.</li></ul>Characteristics:<ul><li>High Leverage: Index futures typically have high leverage, allowing investors to control large market positions with relatively small amounts of capital.</li><li>High Liquidity: Major index futures contracts usually have high trading volumes and liquidity, making it easier for investors to enter and exit the market.</li><li>Risk Management Tool: Index futures can be used to hedge the systematic risk of a stock portfolio.</li></ul></p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1: S&P 500 Index Futures</strong><br/>Suppose an investor expects the U.S. stock market to rise in the next three months. They can buy S&P 500 Index futures contracts. If the S&P 500 Index indeed rises after three months, the investor can profit by selling the futures contracts.<br/><strong>Case 2: Hang Seng Index Futures</strong><br/>An investor holds a large amount of Hong Kong stocks but is concerned about a potential short-term market decline. They can sell Hang Seng Index futures contracts to hedge. If the market declines, the profit from the futures contracts can partially offset the losses from the stock investments.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>1. What is the difference between index futures and stock futures?</strong><br/>Index futures are based on stock market indices, while stock futures are based on individual stocks. Index futures are suitable for predicting and hedging the overall market trend, whereas stock futures are suitable for predicting and hedging the price of individual stocks.<br/><strong>2. What are the risks of investing in index futures?</strong><br/>The main risks include market risk, leverage risk, and liquidity risk.
