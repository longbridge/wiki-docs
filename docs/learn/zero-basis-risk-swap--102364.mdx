A zero basis risk swap (ZEBRA) is an interest rate swapÂ agreement between a municipality and a financial intermediary. A swap is an agreement with two counterparties, where one party pays the other party a fixed interest rate and receives a floating rate.This particular swap is considered zero-risk because the municipality receives a floating rate that is equal to the floating rate on its debt obligations, meaning that there is no basis risk with the trade. The ZEBRA is also known as a "perfect swap" or "actual rate swap."

<AIContent content={`<h2>Zero Basis Risk Swap</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A Zero Basis Risk Swap (ZEBRA) is an interest rate swap agreement between a municipal entity and a financial intermediary.

This specific type of swap is considered zero risk because the municipal entity receives a floating rate that matches its debt obligations, eliminating basis risk. Zero Basis Risk Swaps are also known as 'perfect swaps' or 'actual rate swaps.'</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of Zero Basis Risk Swaps originated in the 1980s when the municipal bond market was maturing, and municipal entities began seeking more effective interest rate management tools. By partnering with financial intermediaries, municipal entities could lock in fixed-rate payments while receiving floating rates that matched their debt obligations, thus eliminating basis risk.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Zero Basis Risk Swaps can be categorized into two main types: standard zero basis risk swaps and customized zero basis risk swaps.
