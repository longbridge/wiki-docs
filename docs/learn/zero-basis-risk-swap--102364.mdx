A zero basis risk swap (ZEBRA) is an interest rate swapÂ agreement between a municipality and a financial intermediary. A swap is an agreement with two counterparties, where one party pays the other party a fixed interest rate and receives a floating rate.This particular swap is considered zero-risk because the municipality receives a floating rate that is equal to the floating rate on its debt obligations, meaning that there is no basis risk with the trade. The ZEBRA is also known as a "perfect swap" or "actual rate swap."
