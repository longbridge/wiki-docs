A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an over-the-counter (OTC) contract between parties that determines the rate of interest to be paid on an agreed-upon date in the future. In other words, an FRA is an agreement to exchange an interest rate commitment on a notional amount.The forward rate agreement determines the rates to be used along with the termination date and notional value. FRAs are cash-settled. The payment is based on the net difference between the interest rate of the contract and the floating rate in the marketâ€”the reference rate. The notional amount is not exchanged. It is a cash amount based on the rate differentials and the notional value of the contract.
