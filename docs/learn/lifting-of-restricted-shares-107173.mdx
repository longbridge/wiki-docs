Restricted stock lifting refers to a system in the stock market where shareholders are unable to sell their held stocks for a certain period of time. After this period ends, shareholders are free to sell their held stocks. The lifting of restrictions on stock sales usually has a certain impact on the stock market and may lead to fluctuations in stock prices.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Lock-up Expiration</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Lock-up expiration refers to a system in the stock market where shareholders are restricted from selling their shares for a certain period. When this period ends, shareholders are free to sell their shares. Lock-up expiration can have an impact on the stock market, potentially causing price fluctuations.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The lock-up expiration system originated from the need for regulation in the securities market to prevent major shareholders or insiders from selling large amounts of stock immediately after a company goes public, which could cause market volatility. The earliest lock-up expiration systems can be traced back to the early 20th century in the U.S. securities market. As global securities markets developed, this system was gradually adopted by various countries.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Lock-up expiration mainly falls into two categories: IPO lock-up expiration and private placement lock-up expiration. IPO lock-up expiration occurs after a companyâ€™s initial public offering (IPO), where original shareholders are restricted from selling their shares for a certain period, usually ranging from 6 months to 1 year. Private placement lock-up expiration occurs when new shares issued through private placement are restricted from being sold for a certain period, typically ranging from 1 to 3 years.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A company went public in 2022, and the original shareholders' shares were locked up for 6 months. In early 2023, these locked-up shares were released, allowing the original shareholders to sell their shares freely. Due to the large number of shares being unlocked, the market anticipated a potential drop in stock price, leading to price fluctuations before the lock-up expiration.</p><p>Case 2: A company conducted a private placement in 2021, and the newly issued shares were locked up for 1 year. When the lock-up period ended in 2022, investors holding these new shares were free to sell them. As the market had a positive outlook on the company, the stock price did not experience significant volatility after the lock-up expiration; instead, it increased.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Is the impact of lock-up expiration on stock prices always negative?<br/>Not necessarily. While lock-up expiration can lead to a drop in stock prices, it can also result in an increase if the market has a positive outlook on the company.</p><p>2. How should investors respond to lock-up expiration?<br/>Investors should pay attention to the timing and quantity of lock-up expirations, assess their potential impact on stock prices, and adjust their investment strategies accordingly.</p>`} id={107173} />
