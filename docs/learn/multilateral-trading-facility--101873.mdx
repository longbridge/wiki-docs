A multilateral trading facility (MTF) is a European term for a trading system that facilitates the exchange of financial instruments between multiple parties.MTFs allow eligible contract participants to gather and transfer a variety of securities, especially instruments that may not have an official market. These facilities are often electronic systems controlled by approved market operators or larger investment banks. Traders usually submit orders electronically, where a matching software engine pairs buyers with sellers.
