A Beacon score is one of many credit scoring models developed by FICO, the major company in that field. It is still in use today but is currently branded simply as a FICO score. In years past it was often referred to as an Equifax Beacon score, after the credit bureau Equifax. For example, a Beacon 5.0 score is now known as a FICO Score 5, according to FICO. That score remains in wide use in the mortgage industry.
