Default risk is the risk a lender takes that a borrower will not make the required payments on a debt obligation, such as a loan, a bond, or a credit card. Lenders and investors are exposed to default risk in virtually all forms of credit offerings. A higher level of default risk typically requires the borrower to pay a higher interest rate.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Default risk refers to the risk that a borrower will not be able to make the required payments on their debt obligations (such as loans, bonds, or credit cards). Almost all forms of credit products expose borrowers and investors to default risk. Higher levels of default risk typically require borrowers to pay higher interest rates.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of default risk dates back to the early stages of financial transactions in ancient times. Lending activities existed back then, and the risk of borrowers failing to repay on time also emerged. With the development of financial markets, methods for managing and assessing default risk have gradually improved. In particular, the emergence of credit rating agencies in the 20th century made the assessment of default risk more systematic and standardized.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Default risk can be categorized into the following types:<ul><li><strong>Credit Default Risk:</strong> This is the most common type of default risk, referring to the risk that a borrower will not make timely payments of principal and interest on loans or bonds.</li><li><strong>Market Default Risk:</strong> This refers to the risk that changes in market conditions will prevent a borrower from fulfilling their debt obligations.</li><li><strong>Operational Default Risk:</strong> This refers to the risk of default due to internal management or operational failures.</li></ul>The characteristics of these risks are that they can all lead to financial losses for investors, and therefore need to be managed through interest rates, collateral, and credit ratings.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> During the 2008 financial crisis, many financial institutions suffered significant losses due to defaults on subprime loans. Borrowers of subprime loans typically had lower credit scores and higher default risk, leading to severe liquidity issues for financial institutions.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company issued high-yield bonds (commonly known as junk bonds) but failed to make timely interest payments due to poor business performance, resulting in losses for investors. These bonds usually have higher interest rates but also higher default risk.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>How to assess default risk?</strong> Default risk is typically assessed through credit ratings, financial statement analysis, and market condition evaluations.</li><li><strong>How to manage default risk?</strong> Default risk can be managed by diversifying investments, purchasing credit default swaps (CDS), and selecting borrowers with high credit ratings.</li></ul></p>`} id={100997} />
