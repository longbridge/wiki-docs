A capitalized cost is an expense added to the cost basis of a fixed asset on a company's balance sheet. Capitalized costs are incurred when building or purchasing fixed assets. Capitalized costs are not expensed in the period they were incurred but recognized over a period of time via depreciation or amortization.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Capitalized costs refer to expenditures that are recorded on a company's balance sheet as part of the cost basis of fixed assets. These costs are incurred during the construction or purchase of fixed assets and are not expensed immediately. Instead, they are recognized over time through depreciation or amortization.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of capitalized costs originates from accounting standards aimed at more accurately reflecting a company's financial position and performance. In early accounting practices, companies would expense all expenditures immediately, which could lead to significant volatility in financial statements. To better match revenues and expenses, the practice of capitalizing costs was gradually introduced and standardized.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Capitalized costs can be divided into direct costs and indirect costs.<ul><li><strong>Direct Costs:</strong> These include the purchase price of fixed assets, transportation costs, installation costs, etc. These costs can be directly attributed to specific fixed assets.</li><li><strong>Indirect Costs:</strong> These include indirect expenses incurred during the construction or purchase of fixed assets, such as administrative expenses, interest expenses, etc. These costs need to be allocated to fixed assets through a reasonable method.</li></ul>The main characteristic of capitalized costs is that they do not immediately impact the company's income statement but are gradually recognized over multiple accounting periods through depreciation or amortization.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case One:</strong> A manufacturing company purchases a machine worth 1 million yuan. In addition to the purchase price, the company also pays 100,000 yuan for transportation and 50,000 yuan for installation. According to the principle of capitalized costs, these expenses totaling 1.15 million yuan will be recorded as fixed assets on the balance sheet and gradually recognized through depreciation over the useful life of the machine.</li><li><strong>Case Two:</strong> A real estate development company incurs 200,000 yuan in interest expenses while constructing an office building. According to the principle of capitalized costs, these interest expenses will also be included in the cost basis of the office building and gradually recognized through depreciation in the future.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question One:</strong> Why capitalize costs instead of expensing them immediately?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Capitalizing costs allows for a more accurate matching of revenues and expenses, avoiding significant volatility in financial statements.</li><li><strong>Question Two:</strong> Can all expenditures be capitalized?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Not all expenditures can be capitalized. Only those directly related to the construction or purchase of fixed assets can be capitalized.</li></ul></p>`} id={101759} />
