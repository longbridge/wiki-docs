The phrase "near the money" refers to an options contract whose strike price is close to the current market price of the corresponding underlying security. Near-the-money is synonymous with at-the-money. It is very seldom that the underlying asset's price will be exactly at the strike price.So, near-the-money is used and the strike price can be higher or lower than the market price. "Close to the money" is an alternative phrase, designating the same situation. It is very close to being "at the money"(ATM), but not quite the same.A call option is considered "in the money" (ITM) if its strike price is lower than the market price. However, if the strike price is higher than the market price, it would be "out of the money" (OTM). A put option's moneyness would work in opposite direction.Also, the option's premiums would need to be accounted for before it can be deemed to be in-the-money. Near the money is one of the states of option moneyness, along with in-the-money and out-of-the-money (OTM).
