Premiums received in advance reflect the financial risk and outstanding obligations of insurance companies in financial statements.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Advance premium refers to the premium paid by the insured to the insurance company before the insurance contract takes effect. The insurance company treats the advance premium as a liability until the insurance contract takes effect and the corresponding insurance responsibility begins. Advance premiums reflect the financial risk and unexpired liability of the insurance company in the financial statements.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of advance premium originated in the early development stages of the insurance industry. At that time, insurance companies required the insured to pay part or all of the premium before the contract took effect to ensure liquidity and risk management.

After the contract took effect, this advance premium was converted into revenue, and the corresponding insurance responsibility began.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another insurance company launched an auto insurance product allowing the insured to pay 50% of the premium before the contract took effect, with the remaining part to be paid within one month after the contract took effect. The insured paid an advance premium of 500 yuan, and the insurance company recorded this amount as a liability. After the contract took effect, the insurance company continued to follow up on the remaining 500 yuan collection and began to assume insurance responsibility after the full premium was received.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Will advance premiums affect the financial statements of the insurance company?</strong> Yes, advance premiums are reflected as liabilities in the financial statements until the insurance contract takes effect and the insurance responsibility begins, at which point they are converted into revenue.</li><li><strong>What impact do advance premiums have on the insured?</strong> Advance premiums require the insured to pay the premium before the contract takes effect, which may increase short-term financial pressure but also ensures the smooth commencement of the insurance contract.</li></ul></p>`} id={290} />
