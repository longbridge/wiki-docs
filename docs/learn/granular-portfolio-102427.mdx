A granular portfolio is an investment portfolio that is well diversified across a wide variety of assets, typically with a significant number of holdings. Because this type of portfolio contains a large number of positions in different asset classes and/or sectors, it is considered to have a lower overall risk profile. Conversely, portfolios that have "low granularity" have fewer positions or contain highly correlated assets. They are less diversified and have a higher overall risk profile.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A fine-grained portfolio is an investment portfolio that is broadly diversified across multiple assets, typically with a large number of holdings. Because this type of portfolio holds significant positions in different asset classes and/or industries, it is considered to have lower overall risk. Conversely, a portfolio with 'low granularity' has fewer positions or contains highly correlated assets, resulting in less diversification and higher overall risk.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of a fine-grained portfolio originates from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s. Markowitz's theory emphasized reducing risk through diversification, which has evolved into today's fine-grained portfolio strategies.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Fine-grained portfolios can be categorized as follows:<ul><li><strong>Asset Class Diversification:</strong> Investing in various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities.</li><li><strong>Industry Diversification:</strong> Holding stocks in different industries such as technology, healthcare, and finance.</li><li><strong>Geographic Diversification:</strong> Investing in assets from different countries and regions.</li></ul>The main characteristics of fine-grained portfolios are risk diversification, increased stability, and potential returns.</p><p><strong>Comparison with Similar Concepts:</strong> In contrast to fine-grained portfolios, low-granularity portfolios hold fewer positions or highly correlated assets, resulting in higher risk and greater volatility.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> An investor creates a fine-grained portfolio containing 500 different company stocks spread across multiple industries such as technology, healthcare, and finance. Due to diversification, this portfolio has lower overall risk even if one industry underperforms.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A fund manager oversees a global investment fund that invests in stocks and bonds from North America, Europe, and Asia. Through geographic diversification, the fund maintains relatively stable returns even if one region's economy declines.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does a fine-grained portfolio always reduce risk?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> While a fine-grained portfolio reduces individual asset risk through diversification, systemic market risk still exists and cannot be entirely eliminated.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to choose a suitable fine-grained portfolio?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Investors should select a fine-grained portfolio based on their risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.</li></ul></p>`} id={102427} />
