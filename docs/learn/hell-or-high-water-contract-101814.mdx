A hell or high water contract (also known as a promise-to-pay contract) is a non-cancelable contract. A hell or high water contract stipulates that the purchaser must make the specified payments to the seller, regardless of any difficulties they may encounter. Hell or high water clauses bind the purchaser or lessee to the terms of the contract until the contract's expiration.
