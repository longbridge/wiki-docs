<p>A growth fund is a type of investment fund that focuses on investing in stocks of companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market. The primary objective of a growth fund is capital appreciation, achieved by investing in companies with high growth potential. These companies typically exhibit strong market positions, innovative products or services, and rapidly increasing revenues and profits. While these stocks may have high price-to-earnings ratios, growth fund managers believe that future earnings growth will justify the current high valuations. Growth funds aim for significant capital gains, and therefore, they generally carry higher risk but also offer the potential for substantial returns.</p>
