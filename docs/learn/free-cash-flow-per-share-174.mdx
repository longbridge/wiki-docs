<p>Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF per Share) is a financial metric that measures the amount of cash generated by a company that is available to be distributed among its shareholders, after accounting for operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes, divided by the total number of outstanding shares. It is an important indicator of a company's financial health and its ability to generate cash returns for its shareholders. This metric reflects the actual cash earnings available to shareholders after maintaining and expanding the company's asset base.</p>
