<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(0,0,0,0.05)",color:"rgb(36,41,47)"}}>Jensen's Measure, also known as Jensen's Alpha, is a financial metric used to evaluate the performance of an investment portfolio. It was introduced by Michael Jensen in 1968, hence the name. Jensen's Measure assesses the excess return of a portfolio by comparing its actual return to its expected return, which is typically derived from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). If the portfolio's actual return exceeds the expected return, the Jensen's Measure is positive, indicating that the portfolio has outperformed market expectations. Conversely, if the actual return is below the expected return, the Jensen's Measure is negative, indicating underperformance. Jensen's Measure is crucial for assessing the investment skills of fund managers and the effectiveness of their investment strategies.</span></p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>Jensen's Measure, also known as Jensen's Alpha, is a financial metric used to evaluate the performance of an investment portfolio. It was introduced by Michael Jensen in 1968. Jensen's Measure assesses the excess return of a portfolio by comparing its actual return to its expected return, which is typically calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). If the actual return of the portfolio exceeds the expected return, Jensen's Measure is positive, indicating that the portfolio outperformed market expectations; conversely, if the actual return is lower than the expected return, Jensen's Measure is negative, indicating underperformance.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>Jensen's Measure was first introduced by Michael Jensen in 1968. In his research, Jensen used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate the expected return and compared it with the actual return to evaluate the performance of investment portfolios. This method provided a new perspective for portfolio performance evaluation, especially in assessing the investment skills and strategy effectiveness of fund managers.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>Jensen's Measure is primarily used in the following evaluations:<br/>1. <strong>Fund Performance Evaluation:</strong> Jensen's Measure can assess whether fund managers can achieve excess returns through stock selection and market timing.<br/>2. <strong>Investment Strategy Evaluation:</strong> It helps investors evaluate the effectiveness of different investment strategies, determining whether they can achieve excess returns after adjusting for risk.<br/>3. <strong>Market Comparison:</strong> Jensen's Measure can be used to compare the performance of investment portfolios across different markets or industries, aiding investors in choosing better investment directions.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>Case 1: Suppose a fund has an actual annual return of 12%, while the expected return calculated using CAPM is 8%. Jensen's Measure would be 12% - 8% = 4%, indicating that the fund outperformed market expectations.<br/>Case 2: Another fund has an actual annual return of 6%, while the expected return is 8%. Jensen's Measure would be 6% - 8% = -2%, indicating that the fund underperformed.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Is Jensen's Measure applicable to all types of investment portfolios?</strong><br/>Jensen's Measure is mainly applicable to investment portfolios of highly liquid assets such as stocks and funds. It may not be as suitable for some illiquid assets.<br/>2. <strong>How to interpret a negative Jensen's Measure?</strong><br/>A negative Jensen's Measure indicates that the actual return of the portfolio is lower than the expected return, suggesting underperformance.</p>`} id={100643} />
