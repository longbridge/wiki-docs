Short selling balance refers to the number of margin-traded stocks that investors have not yet sold in short selling transactions. Short selling refers to the practice of borrowing stocks from a broker, selling them, and then buying them back at a lower price to return them to the broker, thereby profiting from the difference. Short selling balance reflects the number of stocks that investors can currently use for margin trading.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The balance of securities lending refers to the number of securities that investors have borrowed but not yet sold in a securities lending transaction. Securities lending is a transaction in which investors borrow stocks from brokers, sell the borrowed stocks, and then buy them back at a lower price to return to the broker, thereby earning the price difference. The balance of securities lending reflects the number of stocks that investors can currently use for securities lending transactions.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Securities lending transactions originated from the development needs of financial markets, dating back to the 19th century in the U.S. stock market. With the continuous development of financial markets, securities lending transactions have gradually become popular worldwide, becoming an important tool for investors to manage risks and speculate.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Securities lending transactions can be divided into two categories: ordinary securities lending transactions and credit securities lending transactions. Ordinary securities lending transactions refer to transactions where investors borrow stocks through brokers, while credit securities lending transactions refer to securities lending transactions conducted through credit accounts. The characteristics of ordinary securities lending transactions are relatively simple operations but require a certain borrowing fee; credit securities lending transactions can leverage the effect of leverage to amplify investment returns but also increase investment risks.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: An investor believes that the price of a certain stock will fall, so they borrow 1,000 shares of the stock from a broker and sell them at a price of 50 yuan per share. Subsequently, the stock price falls to 40 yuan per share, and the investor buys back 1,000 shares at 40 yuan per share and returns them to the broker. Through this transaction, the investor earns a price difference of (50-40)*1000=10,000 yuan. Case 2: An investor chooses to conduct a securities lending transaction to hedge risks when the market is uncertain. The investor borrows 500 shares of a certain stock and sells them at a market price of 60 yuan per share. Subsequently, the stock price rises to 70 yuan per share, and the investor buys back 500 shares at 70 yuan per share and returns them to the broker. Although the investor loses (70-60)*500=5,000 yuan in this transaction, they achieve risk hedging through the returns of other investment portfolios.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What are the risks of securities lending transactions? Answer: The main risks of securities lending transactions include market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. Market risk refers to the risk brought by stock price fluctuations; liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable to close positions in time due to insufficient buy and sell orders in the market; credit risk refers to the risk of default by the broker or counterparty from whom the stocks were borrowed. 2. What should be done when the balance of securities lending is insufficient? Answer: When the balance of securities lending is insufficient, investors can choose to wait for the broker to replenish the stocks or conduct securities lending transactions through other brokers.</p>`} id={105024} />
