A prospectus is aÂ formal document required by and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that provides details about an investment offering to the public. A prospectus is filed for offerings of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.The prospectus can help investors make more informed investment decisions because it contains a host of relevant information about the investment or security. In areas other than investing, a prospectus is a printed document that advertises or describes an offering such as a school, commercial enterprise, forthcoming book, etc. All forms of prospectus exist to attract or inform clients, members, buyers, or investors.
