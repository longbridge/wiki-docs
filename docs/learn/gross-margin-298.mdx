Gross profit margin refers to the ratio between a company's gross profit and its sales revenue. Gross profit margin can be used to evaluate a company's profitability and operational efficiency. A higher gross profit margin means that a company is able to produce products or provide services at lower costs and generate higher profits from sales. Changes in gross profit margin can reflect changes in a company's profitability and market competitiveness.
