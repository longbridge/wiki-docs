A bond quote is the last price at which a bond traded, expressed as a percentage of par value and converted to a point scale. Par value is generally set at 100, representing 100% of a bond's face value of $1,000. For example, if a corporate bond is quoted at 99, that means it is trading at 99% of face value. In this case, the cost to buy each bond is $990.
