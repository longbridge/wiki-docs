An acquisition premium is a figure that's the difference between the estimated real value of a company and the actual price paid to acquire it. An acquisition premium represents the increased cost of buying a target company during a merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction.There is no requirement that a company pay a premium for acquiring another company; in fact, depending on the situation, it may even get a discount.
