Negative convexity exists when the shape of a bond's yield curve is concave. A bond's convexity is the rate of change of its duration, and it is measured as the second derivative of the bond's price with respect to its yield. Most mortgage bonds are negatively convex, and callable bonds usually exhibit negative convexity at lower yields.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Negative convexity refers to the phenomenon where a bond's price sensitivity to changes in yield decreases when the yield curve is concave. Specifically, convexity is the rate of change of a bond's duration, and negative convexity indicates that the second derivative of the bond's price with respect to its yield is negative. Most mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and callable bonds exhibit negative convexity at lower yields.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of negative convexity originates from the convexity theory in financial mathematics. Convexity was first introduced by financial scholars studying the relationship between bond prices and yields to describe the sensitivity of bond prices to yield changes. With the development of financial markets, especially the emergence of MBS and callable bonds, negative convexity has become an important area of study.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Negative convexity mainly appears in the following two types of bonds:<ul><li><strong>Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):</strong> Due to the prepayment risk associated with MBS, when market interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their loans, limiting the bond's price increase and exhibiting negative convexity.</li><li><strong>Callable Bonds:</strong> Callable bonds allow issuers to redeem the bonds early when interest rates fall, which also limits the bond's price increase, leading to negative convexity.</li></ul>The characteristic of negative convexity is that the bond's price increase when yields fall is smaller than the price decrease when yields rise.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose an investor holds an MBS, and when market interest rates drop from 5% to 4%, borrowers prepay their loans, causing the bond's price to increase only slightly, exhibiting negative convexity.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company issues a callable bond, and when market interest rates drop from 6% to 4%, the company chooses to redeem the bond early, limiting the bond's price increase, exhibiting negative convexity.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is negative convexity disadvantageous for investors?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Negative convexity means that the bond's price is less sensitive to interest rate decreases than to interest rate increases, limiting the potential gains for investors when interest rates fall.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can investors manage negative convexity risk?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Investors can manage negative convexity risk by diversifying their investments, choosing non-callable bonds, or using financial derivatives.</li></ul></p>`} id={100087} />
