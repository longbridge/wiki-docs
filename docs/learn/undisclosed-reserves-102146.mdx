Undisclosed reserves include unpublished or "hidden" reserves that may not appear on public documents—such as on the balance sheet—but are nonetheless real assets and are considered as such by most banking institutions.Bank reserves are the cash minimums that financial institutions must keep on hand. The Federal Reserve (Fed) sets the requirements in order to ensure that banks have enough money on hand to cover withdrawals.
