Capital structure refers to the ways and proportions in which companies raise funds, including the structure of long-term and short-term capital. The main components of capital structure include shareholder equity, debt, and preferred stock. The rationality of capital structure has an important impact on the operation and development of enterprises, and can determine their ability to repay debts, profitability and risk-bearing capacity.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Capital structure refers to the way a company finances its operations and growth through different sources of funds, including long-term and short-term capital. The main components of capital structure are shareholders' equity, debt, and preferred stock. The rationality of a company's capital structure significantly impacts its operations and development, determining its debt repayment ability, profitability, and risk tolerance.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of capital structure dates back to the 1950s, with the Modigliani-Miller Theorem (MM Theory) proposed by economists Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller laying the foundation for modern capital structure theory. Their research indicated that in a market without taxes and transaction costs, a company's capital structure does not affect its market value.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Capital structure can be divided into the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Shareholders' Equity:</strong> Includes common stock and retained earnings. Equity does not require regular interest payments, but shareholders have the right to share in the company's profits.</li><li><strong>Debt:</strong> Includes short-term and long-term debt. Debt requires regular interest payments, but creditors have priority over shareholders in the event of bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Preferred Stock:</strong> Falls between equity and debt. Preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders in profit distribution and liquidation but usually do not have voting rights.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Similar Concept Comparison:</strong> Capital structure is often confused with financial structure. Financial structure includes all liabilities and equity, while capital structure only includes long-term liabilities and equity.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A tech company raises funds by issuing stocks and long-term bonds. In its capital structure, shareholders' equity accounts for 60%, and long-term debt accounts for 40%. This structure allows the company to leverage debt while maintaining a high equity ratio to reduce financial risk.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A manufacturing company primarily relies on short-term bank loans and retained earnings for financing. In its capital structure, short-term debt accounts for 70%, and shareholders' equity accounts for 30%. While this structure allows for quick access to funds, it may face high repayment pressure during economic downturns.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How should a company choose an appropriate capital structure?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> A company should choose its capital structure based on its operating conditions, industry characteristics, and market environment. Generally, stable cash flows and low operational risk are suitable for a higher debt ratio, while high-risk industries should maintain a higher equity ratio.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Does capital structure affect a company's market value?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> According to the MM Theory, in a market without taxes and transaction costs, capital structure does not affect a company's market value. However, in reality, factors such as taxes, bankruptcy costs, and information asymmetry can cause capital structure to impact a company's value.</li></ul></p>`} id={103214} />
