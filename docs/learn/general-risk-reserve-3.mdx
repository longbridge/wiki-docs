General risk reserve refers to a practice formed by enterprises based on the risk reserve policy, safety margin requirements, and reasonable profit requirements, according to existing conditions and the basis of actual risk provision. General risk reserve is used to offset risks caused by various uncertain factors.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>General risk provision refers to the practice by which a company sets aside funds based on risk reserve policies, safety margin requirements, and reasonable profit expectations, considering current conditions and actual risks. Its purpose is to mitigate risks arising from various uncertainties.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of general risk provision originated from the need for risk management in corporate financial management. As business environments became more complex and uncertain, companies needed a mechanism to address potential financial risks. This concept gradually evolved into a significant component of corporate financial statements, ensuring that companies have sufficient financial buffers when facing uncertainties.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>General risk provisions can be categorized based on industry characteristics and risk preferences. Common types include: 1. Credit risk provision: to address the risk of borrower default. 2. Market risk provision: to handle risks from market price fluctuations. 3. Operational risk provision: to manage risks from internal process or system failures. Each type is characterized by the specific risk it targets and the calculation methods, which usually need to be tailored to the company's specific circumstances.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A bank increased its credit risk provision during the financial crisis to cope with potential loan defaults. This measure helped the bank maintain stable financial conditions during the crisis. Case 2: A manufacturing company increased its market risk provision amid uncertain market demand to handle raw material price fluctuations. This allowed the company to maintain production continuity during market volatility.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues include determining a reasonable level of provision and accurately reflecting these provisions in financial statements. Investors often misunderstand the purpose of provisions, viewing them as extra profits rather than recognizing their function as risk buffers.</p>`} id={3} />
