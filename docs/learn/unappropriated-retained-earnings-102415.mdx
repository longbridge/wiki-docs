Unappropriated retained earnings consist of any portion of a company's retained earnings that are not classified as appropriated retained earnings. Appropriated retained earnings are set aside by the board and are assigned to a specific purpose, such as factory construction, hiring new labor, buying new equipment, or marketing. They will not be distributed to shareholders as dividend payments. Unappropriated retained earnings can be passed on to shareholders in the form of dividend payments.
