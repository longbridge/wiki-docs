A bull spread is an optimistic options strategy designed to profit from a moderate rise in the price of a security or asset. A variety of vertical spread, a bull spread involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of either call options or put options with different strike prices but with the same underlying asset and expiration date. Whether a put or a call, the option with the lower strike price is bought and the one with the higher strike price is sold.A bull call spread is also called a debit call spread because the trade generates a net debt to the account when it is opened. The option purchased costs more than the option sold.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Bull Spread</h2><p><strong>Definition:</strong> A bull spread is an optimistic options strategy aimed at profiting from a moderate rise in the price of a security or asset. It is a type of vertical spread that involves simultaneously buying and selling call or put options with different strike prices but the same underlying asset and expiration date. Whether using call or put options, the strategy involves buying the option with the lower strike price and selling the option with the higher strike price.
