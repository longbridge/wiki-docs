Inflation is a general rise in the price of goods in an economy. Demand-pull inflation causes upward pressure on prices due to shortages in supply, a condition that economists describe as "too many dollars chasing too few goods." An increase in aggregate demand can also lead to this type of inflation.In Keynesian economics, an increase in aggregate demand may be caused by a rise in employment, as companies need to hire more people to increase their output. A tight labor market means higher wages, which translates into greater demand.Demand-pull inflation can be compared with cost-push inflation.
