Residual standard deviation is a statistical term used to describe the difference in standard deviations of observed values versus predicted values as shown by points in a regression analysis.Regression analysis is a method used in statistics to show a relationship between two different variables, and to describe how well you can predict the behavior of one variable from the behavior of another.Residual standard deviation is also referred to as the standard deviation of points around a fitted lineÂ or the standard error of estimate.
