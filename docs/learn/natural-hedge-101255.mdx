A natural hedge is a management strategy that seeks to mitigate risk by investing in assets whose performances are inherently negatively correlated. For instance, a natural hedge against owning financial stocks is to hold bonds, since interest rate changes tend to influence each in opposite fashion,A natural hedge can also be implemented when institutions exploit their normal operating procedures. For example, if they incur expenses in the same currency that their revenues are generated they will actually reduce their exchange rate risk exposure, naturally.
