Key rate duration measures how the value of a debt security or a debt instrument portfolio, generally bonds,Â changes at a specific maturity point along the entirety of the yield curve. When keeping other maturities constant, the key rate duration is used to measure the sensitivity in a debt security's price to a 1% change in yield for a specific maturity.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Key rate duration refers to the sensitivity of the value of a debt security or a portfolio of debt securities (usually bonds) to changes in the yield at a specific maturity point on the yield curve, while other maturities remain unchanged. It measures the price sensitivity of a debt security to a 1% change in the yield of a specific maturity.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of key rate duration originated in the 1980s as financial markets became more complex and the need for risk management increased. It is an extension of the traditional duration concept, aimed at more accurately measuring the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in different parts of the yield curve.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Key rate duration can be categorized based on different maturity points, such as 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, etc. Each maturity point's key rate duration reflects the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in the yield of that specific maturity. Its characteristics include:<ul><li>Precision: Compared to overall duration, key rate duration can more precisely reflect a bond's response to changes in specific maturity yields.</li><li>Diversity: Different maturity points' key rate durations help investors gain a more comprehensive understanding of a bond's interest rate risk.</li><li>Wide Application: Key rate duration is an important tool in risk management and portfolio optimization.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>Suppose an investor holds a 10-year Treasury bond with a current yield of 2%. If the 10-year yield rises by 1% to 3% while other maturities remain unchanged, key rate duration will help the investor estimate the price change of the bond. For example, if the 10-year key rate duration is 8, the price will decrease by approximately 8%.</li><li>A portfolio manager holds bonds of various maturities. By calculating the key rate durations for each maturity point, the manager can better understand and manage the interest rate risk of the entire portfolio. For instance, if the 5-year bond's key rate duration is 6 and the 10-year bond's key rate duration is 9, the manager can adjust holdings based on market expectations.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>How does key rate duration differ from traditional duration?</strong> Key rate duration focuses on the yield changes of specific maturities, while traditional duration measures the impact of overall yield changes on bond prices.</li><li><strong>How is key rate duration calculated?</strong> Calculating key rate duration involves making small adjustments to the yield of a specific maturity and observing the change in bond prices, typically achieved through financial models and software.</li></ul></p>`} id={101939} />
