<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The FOMC meeting refers to the Federal Open Market Committee, which is the monetary policy committee of the Federal Reserve.

The FOMC meetings are regular gatherings of committee members to discuss and decide on interest rate policies, money supply, and other matters related to monetary policy. The decisions made at FOMC meetings have significant impacts on global financial markets and the economy, thus attracting widespread attention.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The FOMC was established in 1933 as part of an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act. Its purpose is to regulate the money supply and interest rates through open market operations, thereby achieving economic stability and growth. Since its inception, the FOMC has played a crucial role in responding to economic crises and controlling inflation.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The FOMC typically holds eight meetings per year, categorized into regular and special meetings. Regular meetings are pre-scheduled, usually every six weeks, while special meetings are convened as needed. The main content of these meetings includes assessing economic conditions, discussing monetary policy tools, and deciding on the federal funds rate target. The FOMC's decisions are highly transparent, with meeting minutes and decisions published afterward.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. During the 2008 financial crisis, the FOMC implemented a series of interest rate cuts and quantitative easing policies, helping the U.S. economy gradually recover. 2. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the FOMC quickly acted to lower interest rates to near zero and implemented large-scale asset purchase programs to support economic activity and employment.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How do FOMC meeting decisions affect ordinary investors? FOMC decisions influence interest rates, which in turn affect loan costs and investment returns. 2. Why are FOMC meetings so important?
