Distressed securities are financial instruments issued by a company that is near to—or currently going through—bankruptcy. Distressed securities can include common and preferred shares, bank debt, trade claims, and corporate bonds.A particular security can also be considered distressed if it fails to maintain certain covenants (obligations incorporated into the debt or security, such as the ability to maintain a certain asset to liability ratio, or a particular credit rating.)As a result of the issuing company's inability to meet its financial obligations, their financial instruments suffer a substantial reduction in value. However, because of the implicit riskiness of distressed securities, they can offer high-risk investors the potential for high returns.
