A revenue deficit occurs when realized net income is less than the projected net income. This happens when the actual amount of revenue and the actual amount of expenditures do not correspond with budgeted revenue and expenditures. This is the opposite of a revenue surplus, which occurs when the actual amount of net income exceeds the projected amount.
