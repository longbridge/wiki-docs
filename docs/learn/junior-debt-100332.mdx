<p>Junior Debt refers to debt that ranks below senior debt in a company's capital structure. In the event of liquidation or bankruptcy, junior debt is repaid after senior debt. Because of its lower repayment priority, junior debt typically carries a higher interest rate to compensate investors for the increased risk. Junior debt can include subordinated loans and subordinated bonds. Investors considering junior debt need to be mindful of the higher credit risk and potential liquidity risk associated with these instruments.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Subordinated debt refers to debt that ranks below senior debt in a company's capital structure.
