<p>High-Performance Computing (HPC) involves using supercomputers and computing clusters to tackle problems and tasks that require substantial computational power. HPC systems significantly enhance computation speed and efficiency through parallel processing and distributed computing, playing a crucial role in scientific research, engineering simulation, data analysis, financial modeling, and artificial intelligence. The applications of HPC are extensive, including weather forecasting, genome sequencing, oil exploration, drug development, and physical simulations.</p><p>HPC is closely related to cloud servers (cloud computing). Cloud computing provides the infrastructure for HPC, enabling users to access and utilize high-performance computing resources over the internet. With cloud servers, users can obtain HPC capabilities on demand without investing in expensive hardware and maintenance costs. Cloud computing platforms such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer HPC as a Service (HPCaaS), allowing users to scale computing resources flexibly to meet large-scale computational needs. Additionally, cloud computing supports elastic computing, dynamically adjusting resource allocation based on task requirements, thus improving computational efficiency and resource utilization.</p>
