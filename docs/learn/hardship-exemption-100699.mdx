The term hardship exemption referred to an exemption granted to individuals who weren't able to afford health insurance due to personal and/or financial circumstances. These exemptions were part of a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law in 2010. Individuals were required to have acceptable health care coverage or else pay a fee. Individuals who weren't able to afford coverage could apply for an exemption where no penalty was assessed. The fee for uninsured individuals was eliminated in 2019 with the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
