Investment bank attention refers to the degree of attention and interest that an investment bank has in a company or project. Investment banks usually evaluate and predict the development prospects of a company or project through research and analysis, and determine whether to invest or provide other financial services based on their evaluation results. A high level of investment bank attention means that the company or project is valued and recognized by investment banks, and may receive more attention and support.
