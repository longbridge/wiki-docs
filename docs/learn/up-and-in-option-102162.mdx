Up-and-in options are a type of exotic option that is often made available through specialized brokers to high-end clients in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The option features both a strike price and a barrier level. As the name suggests, the buyer of the option will benefit once the price of the underlying rises high enough to reach (knock-in) the designated barrier price level. Otherwise, the option will expire worthless.
