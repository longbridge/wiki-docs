<p>Evergreen Funding, also known as Perpetual Funding or Continuous Funding, refers to a method of financing that provides ongoing capital support without a fixed termination date. This type of funding is typically used for long-term projects or business operations, ensuring that funds are continuously available as needed to support growth and development. Evergreen funding is common in venture capital, private equity, and certain types of debt financing, where investors provide periodic or continuous capital injections to support the company's expansion. The primary advantage of evergreen funding is that it offers sustained financial support, reducing the pressure on the business to constantly seek new financing sources.</p>
