Evergreen funding (or evergreen finance) is the gradual infusion of capital into a new or recapitalized enterprise. This type of funding differs from traditional funding, in which all the capital required for a business venture is supplied up front by venture capitalists or other investors as part of a private funding round. When the money is provided up front, the company then invests in short-term, low-risk securities until it is ready to use the money for business operations.
