Assets under management (AUM) is the market value of the investments managed by a person or entity on behalf of clients. AUM is used in conjunction with management performance and management experience when evaluating a company.When calculating AUM, some financial institutions include bank deposits, mutual funds, and cash, while others limit it to funds under discretionary management from individual investors.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assets under management (AUM) refers to the total market value of investments that a financial institution or investment manager manages on behalf of clients. AUM is a key indicator of the size and influence of an investment company, often used to assess its management performance and experience.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of AUM originated with the development of financial markets, particularly in the mid-20th century, as investment funds and the asset management industry emerged. Key events include the popularization of mutual funds and the rise of hedge funds.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> 1. <strong>Bank Deposits:</strong> Some financial institutions include clients' bank deposits in AUM, which are typically highly liquid. 2. <strong>Mutual Funds:</strong> Include funds invested in stocks, bonds, etc., with varying liquidity and risk. 3. <strong>Cash:</strong> The most liquid asset but with lower returns. 4. <strong>Self-Managed Funds:</strong> Managed by individual investors, usually not included in AUM.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. <strong>Case One:</strong> An investment company manages multiple mutual funds with a total market value of $5 billion; the AUM of these funds is $5 billion. 2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> A bank includes clients' deposits and investment portfolios in its AUM, totaling $3 billion.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <strong>What assets are included in AUM?</strong> Standards vary by institution; some include bank deposits and cash, while others only include investment funds. 2. <strong>Is higher AUM always better?</strong> Not necessarily; high AUM indicates large management scale, but management performance and risk must also be considered.</p>`} id={100530} />
