Assets under management (AUM) is the market value of the investments managed by a person or entity on behalf of clients. AUM is used in conjunction with management performance and management experience when evaluating a company.When calculating AUM, some financial institutions include bank deposits, mutual funds, and cash, while others limit it to funds under discretionary management from individual investors.
