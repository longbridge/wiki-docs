<p>An Order Bill (Order Instrument) is a financial document that directs the payment of a specified amount to a particular person or to their order. Order bills are commonly used in commercial transactions to ensure the security and reliability of payments.

Common forms of order bills include checks, drafts, and promissory notes. They are widely used in business activities as they provide a convenient and legally recognized method of payment and transfer.</p>
