A bear call spread, or a bear call credit spread, is a type of options strategy used when an options trader expects a decline in the price of the underlying asset. A bear call spread is achieved by simultaneously selling a call option and buying a call option at a higher strike price but with the same expiration date. The maximum profit to be gained using this strategy is equal to the credit received when initiating the trade.A bear call spread is also called a short call spread. It is considered a limited-risk and limited-reward strategy.
