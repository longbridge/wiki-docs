A unitized fund is a type of investment fund structure that uses pooled money to invest with individually reported unit values for investors. Assets in the pool are managed to a specific objective, often with concentration in one stock. Investors are provided with a daily unitized value for their portion of the investment.Unitized stock funds increase the efficiency of employee stock offerings in benefit plans such as ESOPs. Their unit price can be generally compared to the price of the company's stock.
