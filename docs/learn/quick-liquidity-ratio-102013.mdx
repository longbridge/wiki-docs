The quick liquidity ratio is the total amount of a company’s quick assets divided by the sum of its netliabilities, and for insurance companies includes reinsurance liabilities. In other words, it shows how much easily-convertible-to-money assets, such as cash, short-term investments, equities, and corporate and government bonds nearing maturity, an insurance company can tap into on short notice to meet its financial obligations.The quick liquidity ratio is also commonly referred to as the acid-test ratio or the quick ratio.
