<p>A Construction Loan is a short-term loan used to cover the costs of building a new structure, such as a house, commercial building, or other real estate projects. Borrowers draw funds as needed during the construction phase and typically only pay interest on the drawn amount. Construction loans usually have higher interest rates due to the increased risk. Upon project completion, the borrower typically converts the construction loan into a long-term mortgage or other types of long-term financing. Construction loans are crucial for developers and builders as they provide the necessary funds to initiate and complete construction projects.</p>
