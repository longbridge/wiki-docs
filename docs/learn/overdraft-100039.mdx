<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Overdraft occurs when there are insufficient funds in an account to cover a transaction or withdrawal, but the bank still allows the transaction to proceed. Essentially, it is a credit extension provided by financial institutions when the account balance is zero. Overdraft allows account holders to continue withdrawing money even when there are no funds or insufficient funds in the account.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of overdraft can be traced back to early 19th century England, where banks began allowing customers to make transactions despite insufficient account balances. This practice gradually evolved into the modern overdraft services offered by banks today, becoming a common credit service provided by banks.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Overdrafts can be categorized into authorized overdrafts and unauthorized overdrafts. Authorized overdrafts are pre-agreed arrangements between the bank and the customer, allowing the customer to overdraft up to a certain limit. Unauthorized overdrafts occur without prior agreement and usually incur higher fees and interest. Key characteristics of overdrafts include: 1. Providing short-term cash flow; 2. Potentially high interest and fees; 3. Requirement to repay within a specified period.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Case 1: Xiao Ming has a balance of 100 yuan in his account but needs to pay a bill of 150 yuan. The bank allows him to overdraft 50 yuan and charges a certain overdraft fee. Case 2: Xiao Hong has a zero balance but urgently needs to withdraw 200 yuan in cash. The bank permits her to overdraft 200 yuan and charges interest and fees the following month.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does overdrafting affect credit scores? Yes, frequent overdrafting and failure to repay on time can affect credit scores. 2. How are overdraft fees calculated? Overdraft fees typically include a fixed fee and daily interest, with specific amounts depending on the bank's policy.</p>`} id={100039} />
