<p>Net current asset value per share (NCAVPS) is a measure created by&nbsp;Benjamin Graham&nbsp;as one means of gauging the attractiveness of a stock. A key metric for&nbsp;value investors, NCAVPS is calculated by taking a company's current assets and subtracting total liabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Graham considered preferred stock to be a liability, so these are also subtracted. This is then divided by the number of shares outstanding. NCAV is similar to working capital, but instead of subtracting current liabilities from current assets, total liabilities and preferred stock are subtracted.&nbsp;</p><p>The formula for NCAVPS is:</p><p style={{marginLeft:"40px"}}>NCAVPS = Current Assets - (Total Liabilities + Preferred Stock) รท Shares Outstanding</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS) is a metric introduced by the renowned investor Benjamin Graham to assess the attractiveness of a stock. It is calculated by subtracting a company's total liabilities and preferred stock from its current assets, and then dividing by the number of outstanding shares. This metric is primarily used in value investing to help investors determine if a company is undervalued.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong></p><p>The concept of NCAVPS was first introduced by Benjamin Graham in the 1930s. Known as the 'father of value investing,' Graham detailed this concept in his books 'Security Analysis' and 'The Intelligent Investor.' Graham believed that by calculating the net current asset value per share, investors could identify stocks that were priced below their actual value, thus achieving low-risk investment returns.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Current Assets:</strong> Includes cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets that can be converted to cash within a year.</p><p>2. <strong>Total Liabilities:</strong> Includes both short-term and long-term liabilities.</p><p>3. <strong>Preferred Stock:</strong> Graham considered preferred stock as a liability, so it is also subtracted.</p><p>4. <strong>Outstanding Shares:</strong> The number of common shares that are currently in circulation.</p><p>The characteristic of NCAVPS is that it conservatively evaluates a company's value, making it suitable for identifying stocks that are undervalued by the market.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong></p><p>Case 1: Suppose Company A has current assets of $10 million, total liabilities of $6 million, preferred stock of $1 million, and 1 million outstanding shares. The NCAVPS calculation would be:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;">NCAVPS = ($10M - ($6M + $1M)) รท 1M = $3</p><p>Case 2: Company B has current assets of $20 million, total liabilities of $15 million, preferred stock of $2 million, and 2 million outstanding shares. The NCAVPS calculation would be:</p><p style="margin-left:40px;">NCAVPS = ($20M - ($15M + $2M)) รท 2M = $1.5</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>What is the relationship between NCAVPS and market capitalization?</strong> NCAVPS is the net current asset value per share, while market capitalization is the total number of shares multiplied by the stock price. Both can be used together to assess if a company is undervalued.</p><p>2. <strong>Why is preferred stock considered a liability?</strong> Because preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders in the event of liquidation, Graham considered it similar to a liability.</p>`} id={102663} />
