Last in, first out (LIFO) is a method used to account for business inventory that records the most recently produced items in a series as the ones that are sold first. That is, the cost of the most recent products purchased or produced is the first to be expensed as cost of goods sold (COGS), while the cost of older products, which is often lower, will be reported as inventory.Two alternative methods of inventory costing include first in, first out (FIFO), in which the oldest inventory items are recorded as sold first, and the average cost method, which takes the weighted average of all units available for sale during the accounting period and uses that average cost to determine COGS and ending inventory.
