The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Schedule 13G form is an alternative filing for the Schedule 13D form and is used to report a party's ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a company's total stock issue. Schedule 13G is a shorter version of Schedule 13D with fewer reporting requirements. Schedule 13G can be filed in lieu of the SEC Schedule 13D form as long as the filer meets one of several exemptions.Both Schedule 13D and Schedule 13G forms are referred to as "beneficial ownership reports." According to the SEC, a beneficial owner is anyone who directly or indirectly shares voting power or investment power. These forms are intended to provide information about individuals who have significant holdings in publicly-traded companies and thus, allow for other investors and other interested parties to make informed decisions about their own investments. The ownership of over 5% of a publicly-traded stock is considered significant ownershipÂ and reporting this to the public is a requirement.
