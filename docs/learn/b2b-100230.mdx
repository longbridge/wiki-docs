<p>B2B (Business to Business) is a business model where transactions of products, services, or information occur between businesses rather than between a business and individual consumers. This model typically involves wholesalers, manufacturers, suppliers, and other business clients. B2B transactions are often more complex than B2C transactions, involving longer sales cycles, larger transaction volumes, and higher customization requirements. Typical B2B transactions include the procurement of raw materials, sales of enterprise software, and provision of professional services.</p>
