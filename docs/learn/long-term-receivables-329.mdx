<p>Long-term receivables refer to amounts owed to a company that are expected to be collected over a period exceeding one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer. These receivables typically arise from installment sales, long-term leases, or long-term loans. Long-term receivables are presented as non-current assets on the balance sheet, and companies need to reasonably estimate their value and make provisions for doubtful accounts if necessary.</p>
