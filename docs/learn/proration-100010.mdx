<p>Proration is a type of corporate action that may arise during an event such as an acquisition, where a company splits its original cash and equity offer in response to shareholder preferences.</p><p>In certain situations, the acquiring firm will offer a combination of cash and equity, and shareholders of the firm being acquired can elect to take either. If available cash or shares are not sufficient to satisfy the offers that shareholders tender, the remaining stock is prorated: the company grants a proportion of both cash and shares for each offer tendered so that everyone gets their fair share of the deal.</p><p>Proration should not be confused with pro-rata, which indicates some proportional allocation or distribution.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Proration is a corporate action that may occur during events such as acquisitions, where a company splits its original cash and stock offerings based on shareholders' preferences.</p><p>In some cases, the acquiring company offers a combination of cash and stock, and the shareholders of the acquired company can choose to accept one of them.

With the development of financial markets and the increase in corporate acquisition activities, the proration mechanism has been widely applied.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Proration mainly falls into two categories: cash proration and stock proration.<ul><li><strong>Cash Proration:</strong> When shareholders choose to accept cash, if the total cash is insufficient to meet all shareholders' demands, the company will allocate the cash proportionally.</li><li><strong>Stock Proration:</strong> When shareholders choose to accept stock, if the total stock is insufficient to meet all shareholders' demands, the company will allocate the stock proportionally.</li></ul>The characteristics of proration lie in its fairness and flexibility, ensuring that all shareholders receive a certain return when resources are limited.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Company A acquires Company B, offering an acquisition plan that includes $50 cash or 1 share of Company A stock for each share of Company B stock. Due to limited cash, Company A decides to prorate, and each shareholder ultimately receives a portion of cash and a portion of stock.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Company C undergoes restructuring, and shareholders can choose to accept cash or new company stock.
