Look-alike contracts are a cash-settled financial product based on the settlement price of a similar exchange-traded, physically settled futures contract. Look-alike contracts are traded over the counter and they carry no risk of actual physical delivery regardless of the terms of the underlying futures contract.Futures look-alike contracts are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
