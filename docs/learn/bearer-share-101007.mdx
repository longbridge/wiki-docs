A bearer share is equity security wholly owned by the person or entity that holds the physical stock certificate, thus the name "bearer" share.Â The issuing firm neither registers the owner of the stock nor tracks transfers of ownership; the company disperses dividends to bearer shares when a physical coupon is presented to the firm. Because the share is not registered to any authority, transferring the ownership of the stock involves only delivering the physical document.
