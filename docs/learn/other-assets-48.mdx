Other assets refer to assets that a company owns, excluding current assets and non-current assets. This category includes less common assets such as long-term equity investments, long-term receivables, other long-term investments, and other receivables.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other assets refer to assets that are not classified as current or non-current assets in a company. They include less common assets such as long-term equity investments, long-term receivables, other long-term investments, and other receivables. These assets are typically not part of the company's main operating activities but still need to be reported in financial statements.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of other assets has developed alongside the evolution of accounting standards. As business operations have become more diverse and complex, traditional asset classifications have been insufficient to cover all types of assets, necessitating a more flexible category to handle these uncommon assets.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other assets can be categorized into several types, including long-term equity investments, long-term receivables, other long-term investments, and other receivables. Long-term equity investments typically refer to a company's long-term holdings in other companies; long-term receivables are receivables expected to be collected over a period longer than one year; other long-term investments include non-liquid financial assets held by the company; other receivables refer to receivables that do not fall under accounts receivable. These assets share the common feature of low liquidity and are usually not directly involved in the company's daily operations.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A large manufacturing company lists a long-term equity investment in its financial statements, which is a strategic investment in a supplier to ensure a stable supply of raw materials. Case Study 2: A technology company lists other receivables on its balance sheet, which arise from long-term contracts with partners and are expected to be collected over the next three years.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often face challenges in assessing the true value of other assets. Due to their low liquidity, market prices are difficult to determine, requiring reliance on valuation methods provided by the company. Additionally, the classification and presentation of other assets may vary depending on the company's accounting policies, so investors should carefully read the notes to the financial statements for detailed information.</p>`} id={48} />
