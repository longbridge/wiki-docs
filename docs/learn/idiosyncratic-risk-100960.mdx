Idiosyncratic risk is a type of investment risk that is endemic to an individual asset (like a particular company's stock), a group of assets (like a particular sector), or in some cases a very specific asset class (like collateralized mortgage obligations). Idiosyncratic risk is also referred to as a specific risk or unsystematic risk.Therefore, the opposite of idiosyncratic risk is a systematic risk, which is the overall risk that affects all assets, such as fluctuations in the stock market, interest rates, or the entire financial system.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Specific Risk</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Specific risk refers to the investment risk associated with individual assets (such as a particular company's stock), a group of assets (such as a specific industry), or certain asset classes (such as mortgage-backed securities). Specific risk is also known as idiosyncratic risk or unsystematic risk. In contrast, systematic risk affects all assets, such as market volatility, interest rate changes, or the entire financial system.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of specific risk originates from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), proposed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s. Markowitz's research demonstrated that diversification could reduce specific risk because the performance of different assets is not perfectly correlated.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Specific risk can be divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Company-specific risk:</strong> Risk related to the operational status, management decisions, and financial health of a particular company. For example, a product recall or management change in a company can cause its stock price to fluctuate.</li><li><strong>Industry-specific risk:</strong> Risk related to the market environment, policy changes, and technological advancements in a specific industry. For example, fluctuations in oil prices can significantly impact the energy sector.</li><li><strong>Asset class-specific risk:</strong> Risk related to the market characteristics, liquidity, and credit risk of a specific asset class. For example, the default risk of mortgage-backed securities.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1: Company-specific risk</strong><br/>Suppose you invest in a tech company's stock, and the company releases a new product that is recalled due to technical issues, causing the stock price to plummet. This situation is a typical example of company-specific risk.</p><p><strong>Case 2: Industry-specific risk</strong><br/>Suppose you invest in several oil companies' stocks, and suddenly international oil prices crash, causing the stock prices of these companies to drop significantly. This situation is an example of industry-specific risk.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can specific risk be reduced?<br/><strong>A:</strong> By diversifying investments, i.e., spreading funds across different assets, industries, and regions, specific risk can be effectively reduced.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between specific risk and systematic risk?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Specific risk pertains to individual assets or specific asset classes, while systematic risk affects the entire market or financial system.</p>`} id={100960} />
