<p>The term SEC Form N-Q refers to a document that registered management investment companies were required to submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in order to disclose their complete portfolio holdings.&nbsp;</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>The N-Q Fund Quarterly Report is a report submitted by investment companies every quarter, containing unaudited financial data and a summary of the investment portfolio. These reports help investors understand the financial status and investment strategy of the fund.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The origin of the N-Q report can be traced back to the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aimed at increasing transparency and information disclosure of investment funds. In 2004, the SEC passed a rule requiring investment companies to submit N-Q reports quarterly, allowing investors to obtain financial information about the fund more frequently.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Financial Data:</strong> The N-Q report contains unaudited financial data such as balance sheets and income statements. This data provides a snapshot of the fund's financial health.<br/>2. <strong>Investment Portfolio Summary:</strong> The report also includes a summary of the fund's investment portfolio, listing major holdings and investment strategies, helping investors understand the fund's investment direction.<br/>3. <strong>Transparency:</strong> The N-Q report increases the transparency of fund operations, enabling investors to better assess the fund's performance and risk.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case One:</strong> An investment company disclosed in its N-Q report that its major holdings are tech stocks and listed the top ten holdings in detail. This allows investors to understand the fund's investment focus and assess its risk.<br/>2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> Another fund company showed in its N-Q report that it holds a large amount of bond assets. Investors can use this information to determine that the fund has lower risk, making it suitable for conservative investors.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Why is the data in the N-Q report unaudited?</strong><br/>Since the N-Q report is a quarterly report, the unaudited data can be provided to investors more quickly due to the shorter time frame.<br/>2. <strong>How to use the N-Q report for investment decisions?</strong><br/>Investors can analyze the financial data and investment portfolio summary in the N-Q report to assess the fund's performance and risk, thereby making more informed investment decisions.</p>`} id={200024} />
