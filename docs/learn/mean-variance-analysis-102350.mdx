Mean-variance analysis is the process of weighing risk, expressed as variance,Â against expected return. Investors use mean-variance analysis to make investment decisions. Investors weigh how much risk they are willing to take on in exchange for different levels of reward. Mean-variance analysis allows investors to find the biggest reward at a given level of risk or the least risk at a given level of return.
