Multicollinearity is the occurrence of high intercorrelations among two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model.Â Multicollinearity can lead to skewed or misleading results when a researcher or analyst attempts to determine how well each independent variable can be used most effectively to predict or understand the dependent variable in a statistical model.In general, multicollinearity can lead to wider confidence intervals that produce less reliable probabilities in terms of the effect of independent variables in a model.In technical analysis, multicollinearity can lead to incorrect assumptions about an investment. It generally occurs because multiple indicators of the same type have been used to analyze a stock.
