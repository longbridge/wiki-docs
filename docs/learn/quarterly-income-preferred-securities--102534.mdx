Quarterly Income Preferred Securities (QUIPS)Â are hybrid, preferred-stock-like securities. They represent an interest in a limited partnership or company that exists solely for the purpose of issuing these preferred shares and then lending the proceeds of the sales to its parent company. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), they usually have a $25 par value and cumulative quarterly distributions.
