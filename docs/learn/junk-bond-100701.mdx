Junk bonds are bonds that carry a higher risk of default than most bonds issued by corporations and governments. A bond is a debt or promise to pay investors interest payments along with the return of invested principal in exchange for buying the bond. Junk bonds represent bonds issued by companies that are financially struggling and have a high risk of defaulting or not paying their interest payments or repaying the principal to investors.Junk bonds are also called high-yield bonds since the higher yield is needed to help offset any risk of default.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Junk bonds are bonds that are more likely to default compared to most bonds issued by companies and governments. A bond is a debt or promise to pay interest and return the invested principal to investors. Junk bonds are issued by companies in financial distress and have a high risk of default or inability to pay interest or repay principal. Junk bonds are also known as high-yield bonds because they require higher yields to offset the risk of default.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of junk bonds originated in the 1970s and 1980s when some investment banks began specializing in issuing high-risk, high-yield bonds. Michael Milken was a pioneer in this field, promoting the use of junk bonds through Drexel Burnham Lambert, making them an important tool for corporate financing.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Junk bonds can be divided into two categories: 1. <strong>Newly issued junk bonds</strong>, typically issued by emerging companies or companies in poor financial condition; 2. <strong>Downgraded bonds</strong>, which were originally investment-grade bonds but were downgraded to junk status due to the deteriorating financial condition of the issuing company. The main characteristics of junk bonds include high yield, high risk, and lower credit ratings (usually BB or lower).</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. <strong>Hertz Corporation</strong>: Before filing for bankruptcy protection in 2020, Hertz issued a large number of junk bonds. These bonds' high yields attracted many investors but also came with high default risk. 2. <strong>Tesla, Inc.</strong>: In its early development stages, Tesla issued multiple junk bonds to raise funds for research and production. Despite the high risk, these bonds provided the necessary financial support for the company.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <strong>Why are the yields on junk bonds high?</strong> Because the issuing companies are in poor financial condition and have a high risk of default, they need to offer higher yields to attract investors. 2. <strong>What is the main risk of investing in junk bonds?</strong> The main risk is that the issuing company may be unable to pay interest or repay the principal, leading to investor losses.</p>`} id={100701} />
