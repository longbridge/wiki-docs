Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) is a bank accounting term that refers to real estate property assets that a bank holds, but that are not part of its business. Oftentimes, these assets are acquired due to foreclosure proceedings. A large quantity of OREO assets on a bank balance sheet may raise concerns about the overall health of the institution.
