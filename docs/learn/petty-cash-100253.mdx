<p>Petty Cash is a small amount of cash kept on hand by a business or organization to cover minor, everyday expenses. These expenses typically include office supplies, transportation costs, and small employee reimbursements. The purpose of maintaining a petty cash fund is to simplify and expedite the handling of small payments, avoiding the need for frequent check writing or bank transfers. Petty cash is usually managed by a designated custodian, and each use of the fund requires a petty cash voucher to be filled out. Regular reconciliations are conducted to ensure the proper use of funds and the accuracy of records.</p>
