A hedged tender is an investment strategy where an investor sells short a portion of shares they own in anticipation that not all shares tendered will be accepted. This strategy is used to protect against the risk of loss, in case the tender offer does not go through. The offer locks in the shareholder's profit no matter the outcome of the tender offer.
