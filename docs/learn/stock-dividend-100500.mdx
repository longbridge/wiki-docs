<p>A stock dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders in the form of additional shares, rather than cash. When a company earns a profit, it may choose to distribute part of it to shareholders by issuing new shares. Each shareholder receives a proportionate number of additional shares based on their existing holdings. The issuance of stock dividends does not alter the total market value of the company but increases the total number of shares outstanding, thereby diluting earnings per share. Stock dividends are typically used when a company wants to retain cash for reinvestment or other purposes while still providing a return to shareholders.</p>
