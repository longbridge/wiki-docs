<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Chi-Square (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>) statistic is a test method used to measure the difference between a model and actual observed data. It is commonly used for hypothesis testing, comparing the differences between expected and actual results. The data used to calculate the Chi-Square statistic must be randomly selected, raw, mutually exclusive, and drawn from a large sample of independent variables.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Chi-Square test was introduced by British statistician Karl Pearson in 1900. It was initially used in biostatistics for genetic research and later widely applied in social sciences, market research, and medical research.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Chi-Square test mainly includes two types: the test of independence and the goodness-of-fit test.<ul><li><strong>Test of Independence:</strong> Used to determine whether two categorical variables are independent. For example, studying the relationship between gender and purchasing behavior.</li><li><strong>Goodness-of-Fit Test:</strong> Used to determine whether observed data fit a specific distribution. For example, testing whether a die is fair.</li></ul>Characteristics of the Chi-Square test include:<ul><li>Applicable to categorical data.</li><li>Requires a large sample size.</li><li>Results depend on degrees of freedom.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A market research company wants to know if there is a significant difference in brand preference among different age groups. Using the Chi-Square test of independence, they can analyze purchasing data across age groups to determine if age and brand preference are independent.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A school wants to know if students' exam scores follow a normal distribution. Using the Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, they can compare the actual score distribution with the theoretical normal distribution to determine if the scores fit the expected pattern.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Issues:</strong><ul><li><strong>Insufficient Sample Size:</strong> The Chi-Square test requires a large sample size; small samples may lead to unreliable results.</li><li><strong>Non-Independent Data:</strong> Data must come from independent samples; otherwise, results may be distorted.</li><li><strong>Misuse of Degrees of Freedom:</strong> Errors in calculating degrees of freedom can affect the accuracy of the test results.</li></ul></p>`} id={101477} />
