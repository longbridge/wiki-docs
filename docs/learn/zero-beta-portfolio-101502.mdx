<p>A zero-beta portfolio is a portfolio constructed to have zero systematic risk, or in other words, a beta of zero. A zero-beta portfolio would have the same expected return as the risk-free rate. Such a portfolio would have zero correlation with market movements, given that its expected return equals the risk-free rate or a relatively low rate of return compared to higher-beta portfolios.</p><p>A zero-beta portfolio is quite unlikely to attract investor interest in bull markets, since such a portfolio has no market exposure and would therefore underperform a diversified market portfolio. It may attract some interest during a bear market, but investors are likely to question whether merely investing in risk-free, short-term treasuries is a better and cheaper alternative to a zero-cost portfolio.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A zero-beta portfolio is an investment portfolio constructed to have zero systematic risk, meaning its beta value is zero. The expected return of a zero-beta portfolio is equal to the risk-free rate. Since its expected return equals the risk-free rate or is lower compared to high-beta portfolios, this type of portfolio is completely uncorrelated with market fluctuations.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of a zero-beta portfolio originates from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which was introduced by William Sharpe in the 1960s. The CAPM model uses the beta value to measure the systematic risk of individual assets or portfolios relative to the market. The zero-beta portfolio was proposed to explore the performance of a portfolio that completely eliminates market risk.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The main characteristics of a zero-beta portfolio are: 1. Zero systematic risk: Since the beta value is zero, the portfolio is unaffected by market fluctuations. 2. Expected return equals the risk-free rate: Due to the absence of market risk, the portfolio's expected return is the same as the risk-free rate. 3. Limited applicability: In a bull market, a zero-beta portfolio is unlikely to attract investors' interest due to its lower return rate; in a bear market, it may attract some interest, but investors might prefer risk-free short-term government bonds as an alternative.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose Investor A holds a zero-beta portfolio during a bull market. Due to the overall market rise, A's portfolio underperforms compared to the market average. Case 2: In a bear market, Investor B holds a zero-beta portfolio. Although the overall market declines, B's portfolio remains stable, with a return rate equal to the risk-free rate.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why choose a zero-beta portfolio? Answer: A zero-beta portfolio is suitable for investors who wish to completely avoid market risk. 2. What are the disadvantages of a zero-beta portfolio? Answer: Its main disadvantage is the lower return rate, especially in a bull market where it underperforms compared to the market average.</p>`} id={101502} />
