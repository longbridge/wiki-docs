<p>The Over-The-Counter (OTC) Market refers to a decentralized market where securities are traded directly between parties, typically through a network of brokers and dealers, rather than on a centralized exchange. Unlike stock exchanges, the OTC market does not have a physical trading floor; transactions are conducted via telephone, computer networks, and other electronic systems. The OTC market includes a wide range of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other securities. Due to the lack of centralized regulation, the OTC market offers greater flexibility but also comes with higher credit and liquidity risks. Common examples of OTC markets include the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and Pink Sheets in the United States.</p>
