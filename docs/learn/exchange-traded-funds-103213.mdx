Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are open-ended funds that are traded on an exchange and can be bought and sold like stocks. The investment portfolio of an ETF usually tracks a specific index and has lower management fees and trading costs. ETF trading is more flexible compared to other investment products because it can be bought and sold on an exchange at any time.
