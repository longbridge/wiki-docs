The shareholder equity plan is a company's anti-takeover measure designed to protect the company from hostile takeovers by potential acquirers. The plan usually includes the issuance of new shares or stock purchase rights, or gives existing shareholders the right of first refusal to purchase new shares. This plan can make potential acquirers face higher costs or make it more difficult to gain control.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Shareholder Rights Plan, also known as a “Poison Pill,” is an anti-takeover measure adopted by a company to protect itself from hostile takeovers. This plan typically involves issuing new shares or stock purchase rights, or giving existing shareholders the right to purchase new shares preferentially.

In 1982, attorney Martin Lipton first proposed the concept of the “Poison Pill” and implemented it in his client companies, achieving significant results. Subsequently, this strategy was quickly adopted by other companies and became a common anti-takeover measure.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Shareholder Rights Plans are mainly divided into two categories: triggered and non-triggered.<ul><li><strong>Triggered:</strong> The plan automatically takes effect when a potential acquirer holds a certain percentage of the company's shares, allowing existing shareholders to purchase new shares at a discount, thereby diluting the acquirer's stake.</li><li><strong>Non-triggered:</strong> The company's board of directors can decide whether to activate the plan based on specific circumstances, offering greater flexibility.</li></ul>The main characteristics of Shareholder Rights Plans include:<ul><li>Protecting the company from hostile takeovers</li><li>Increasing acquisition costs</li><li>Enhancing the negotiating power of the company's management</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> In 2004, Microsoft implemented a Shareholder Rights Plan to prevent potential hostile takeovers.

The plan allowed existing shareholders to purchase new shares at a discount if any individual or group held more than 10% of the company, thereby diluting Icahn's stake.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does a Shareholder Rights Plan harm shareholder interests?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> While a Shareholder Rights Plan may reduce short-term returns for shareholders, it can protect the company from hostile takeovers in the long run, preserving the company's independence and long-term interests.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is a Shareholder Rights Plan legal?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> In most jurisdictions, Shareholder Rights Plans are legal but must comply with relevant laws and regulations and be approved by the company's board of directors.</li></ul></p>`} id={103733} />
