Simple interest is an interest charge that borrowers pay lenders for a loan. It is calculated using the principal only and does not include compounding interest. Simple interest relates not just to certain loans. It's also the type of interest that banks pay customers on their savings accounts.The formula to determine simple interest is an easy one. Just multiply the loan's principal amount by the annual interest rate by the term of the loan in years.This type of interest usually applies to automobile loans or short-term loans, although some mortgages use this calculation method.
