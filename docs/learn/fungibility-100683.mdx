Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fungibility refers to the ability of a good or asset to be exchanged or replaced with another identical good or asset.
