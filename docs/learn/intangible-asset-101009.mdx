An intangible asset is one that is not physical in nature. Since intangible assets have no shape or form, they cannot be held or manipulated. Common types of intangible assets include brands, goodwill, and intellectual property. Businesses have several ways to value these assets, which can be challenging because they have no shape or form. They are in contrast to tangible assets, which have physical forms and can be held.
