<p>Modified duration is an indicator that measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates. It represents the percentage change in the bond's price for a 1% change in interest rates. The higher the modified duration, the more sensitive the bond's price is to changes in interest rates.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Modified Duration</h2><p>Modified duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It indicates the percentage change in a bond's price for a 1% change in interest rates. The higher the modified duration, the more sensitive the bond price is to changes in interest rates.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of modified duration originates from duration, first introduced by American economist Frederick Macaulay in 1938. Duration was initially used to measure the weighted average time to maturity of a bond. Modified duration builds on this by considering the impact of interest rate changes on bond prices.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>There are several types of duration:</p><ul><li><strong>Macaulay Duration:</strong> The original concept of duration, used to measure the weighted average time to maturity of a bond.</li><li><strong>Modified Duration:</strong> Builds on Macaulay duration by considering the impact of interest rate changes on bond prices.</li><li><strong>Effective Duration:</strong> Used to measure the sensitivity of bonds with embedded options to changes in interest rates.</li></ul><p>The key characteristic of modified duration is its ability to more accurately reflect a bond's price sensitivity to small changes in interest rates.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose a bond has a modified duration of 5 years and the current market interest rate is 3%. If the market interest rate rises by 1% to 4%, the bond's price is expected to decrease by approximately 5%.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another bond has a modified duration of 2 years and the current market interest rate is 3%. If the market interest rate falls by 1% to 2%, the bond's price is expected to increase by approximately 2%.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between modified duration and duration?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Duration primarily measures the weighted average time to maturity of a bond, while modified duration builds on this by considering the impact of interest rate changes on bond prices.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is a higher modified duration better?<br/><strong>A:</strong> A higher modified duration means the bond price is more sensitive to changes in interest rates. This is beneficial when interest rates fall but poses a greater risk of price volatility when interest rates rise.</p>`} id={101058} />
