A joint account is a bank or brokerage account shared between two or more individuals. Joint accounts are most likely to be used by relatives, couples, or business partners who have a level of familiarity and trust with each other.A joint account functions like a standard account, such as a checking or savings account, and allows anyone named on the account to access its funds. All owners can withdraw cash, write checks and make online payments.
