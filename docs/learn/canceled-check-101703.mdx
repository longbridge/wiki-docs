A canceled check is a check that has been paid or cleared by the bank it was drawn on after it has been deposited or cashed. The check is "canceled" after it's been used or paid so that the check cannot be used again.Somebody who has written a check may also cancel it before it has been deposited or cashed by alerting the issuing bank, thus voiding the check.
