<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Issuing additional government bonds refers to the government's expansion of bond issuance to meet fiscal expenditure needs. The purpose of issuing additional government bonds is to raise fiscal funds for national construction and social welfare projects.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of issuing additional government bonds can be traced back to ancient times when governments borrowed funds to finance wars and large public works. The modern concept of issuing additional government bonds began in the 19th century as national fiscal systems became more sophisticated, and governments started issuing bonds to raise funds.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Additional government bonds can be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term bonds. Short-term bonds typically have a maturity of less than one year, with lower interest rates, suitable for temporary fiscal needs; medium-term bonds have a maturity of 1-10 years, with moderate interest rates, suitable for medium-term fiscal planning; long-term bonds have a maturity of more than 10 years, with higher interest rates, suitable for long-term infrastructure and social welfare projects. The characteristics of additional government bonds include: 1. High security, backed by government credit; 2. High liquidity, actively traded in the market; 3. Relatively stable interest rates, suitable for conservative investors.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> 1. After the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. government issued additional bonds to raise substantial funds for economic stimulus plans and financial institution bailouts, aiding economic recovery. 2. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide issued additional bonds to raise funds to address the public health crisis and economic downturn, supporting healthcare systems and social welfare.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Will issuing additional government bonds lead to inflation? Generally, moderate bond issuance does not lead to severe inflation, but excessive issuance may increase inflationary pressure. 2. Is investing in additional government bonds risky? While government bonds are considered safe investments, they still carry interest rate risk and market volatility risk.</p>`} id={104642} />
