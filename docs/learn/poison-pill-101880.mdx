A poison pill is a defense strategy used by the directors of a public company to prevent activist investors, competitors, or other would-be acquirers from taking control of the company. Poison pills are executed by buying up large amounts of its stock. They effectively block the accumulation of a company's outstanding shares.Companies promise to distribute additional free or heavily discounted shares to all existing shareholders, which dilutes the shares so outsiders can't take over the company by purchasing a controlling amount of shares.Another goal is to force the entity trying to acquire the company to negotiate with the company's board for a buyout price. Courts have upheld poison pills as a legitimate defense by corporate boards, which are not obligated to accept any offer they do not deem to be in the company's long-term interest.
