Groupthink is a phenomenon that occurs when a group of individuals reaches a consensus without critical reasoning or evaluation of the consequences or alternatives. Groupthink is based on a common desire not toÂ upset the balance of a group of people.This desire creates a dynamic within a group whereby creativity and individuality tend to be stifled in order to avoid conflict.
