A zombie exchange-traded fundÂ (ETF) is no longer growing and attracting money from new investors. When an ETF enters zombie territory, it is usually only a matter of time before it is shut down by the company that issued it.Investors will get their money back, or most of it. However, they may make less than they had hoped, and taxes will be due on any profits they earned from the fund.
