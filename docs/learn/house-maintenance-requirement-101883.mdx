A house maintenance requirement is the level of minimum margin account equity that is required by a brokerage firm. House maintenance requirement levels are based on the standards set out in Regulation T of the Federal Reserve.Although Regulation T specifies the minimum maintenance requirements permitted by law, brokerage firms are free to adjust their own “house” maintenance requirements, provided that their standards are more rigorous than the minimum requirements set out in Regulation T.
