<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other equity instruments refer to various forms of equity instruments other than common stock. Equity instruments are securities that represent ownership in a company or asset, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible bonds, etc. Other equity instruments can include various special equity instruments such as preference shares and securities with preferential income rights.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of equity instruments has evolved with the development of financial markets. Initially, common stock was the primary equity instrument, but as market demands changed and financial innovation occurred, various forms of equity instruments emerged to meet the diverse needs of investors and corporate financing.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other equity instruments can be categorized into several types, including preferred stock, convertible bonds, and preference shares. Preferred stock typically has priority over common stock in dividends and liquidation but usually lacks voting rights. Convertible bonds allow holders to convert the bonds into company stock under specific conditions. Preference shares may enjoy specific rights, such as fixed dividends or priority in liquidation.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A company issues preferred stock to raise funds while not diluting the voting power of existing shareholders. Preferred stockholders enjoy fixed dividends when the company is profitable. Case 2: Another company issues convertible bonds to attract investors who wish to hold company stock at a lower price in the future. This instrument helps the company borrow at a lower interest rate initially.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors may encounter issues when using other equity instruments, such as understanding the risk and return characteristics of different instruments, particularly the terms of preferred stock and convertible bonds. Additionally, investors might misunderstand the priority and conversion conditions of these instruments.</p>`} id={39} />
