<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Other equity instruments refer to various forms of equity instruments other than common stock. Equity instruments represent securities that indicate ownership in a company or assets, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible bonds, etc. Other equity instruments can include various special equity instruments such as preference shares, income preference securities, etc.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of equity instruments originated from the need for corporate financing. As financial markets developed, companies introduced various forms of equity instruments to meet the needs of different investors. In the early 20th century, with the maturation of capital markets, other equity instruments such as preferred stock and convertible bonds were gradually introduced and widely used.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Other equity instruments mainly include the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Preferred Stock:</strong> Preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders in dividends and liquidation but usually do not have voting rights. Preferred stock is characterized by relatively stable returns and lower risk.</li><li><strong>Convertible Bonds:</strong> Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into the company's common stock under specific conditions. They combine the characteristics of bonds and stocks, offering both fixed income and potential stock price appreciation.</li><li><strong>Preference Shares:</strong> Preference shares usually grant holders certain special rights, such as higher dividends or priority purchase rights under specific circumstances.</li><li><strong>Income Preference Securities:</strong> Holders of these securities have priority in profit distribution, usually offering higher returns but also higher risk.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case One:</strong> A company issues a batch of preferred stock with a par value of 100 yuan per share and an annual dividend rate of 5%. This means that each preferred stockholder can receive a 5 yuan dividend per share annually. Even if the company's performance is poor, preferred stockholders can still receive dividends first.</li><li><strong>Case Two:</strong> A company issues a batch of convertible bonds with a par value of 1,000 yuan and an annual interest rate of 3%, stipulating that they can be converted into the company's common stock at a price of 50 yuan per share within the next five years. If the company's stock price rises to 60 yuan, convertible bondholders can choose to convert to common stock, thereby obtaining higher returns.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question One:</strong> What are the risks of other equity instruments?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The risks of other equity instruments vary by type. Preferred stock has lower risk but also relatively stable returns; convertible bonds have higher risk and returns because they offer both fixed income and potential stock appreciation.</li><li><strong>Question Two:</strong> How to choose suitable other equity instruments?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Investors should choose suitable other equity instruments based on their risk tolerance and return expectations. If seeking stable returns, preferred stock is a good choice; if willing to take on some risk for higher returns, convertible bonds are preferable.</li></ul></p>`} id={39} />
