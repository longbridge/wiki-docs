A bear trap is a technical pattern that occurs when the price action of a stock, index or another financial instrument incorrectly signals a reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend. In other words, prices may move higher in a broad-based incline, only to encounter significant fundamental resistance or change. This prompts bears to open short positions, hoping to profit from an indication of falling prices.A bear is an investor or trader in the financial markets who believes that the price of a security is about to decline. Bears may also believe that a financial market's overall direction may decline. A bearish investment strategy attempts to profit from the decline in the price of an asset, and a short position is often executed to implement this strategy.A short position is a trading technique that borrows shares or contracts of an asset from a broker through a margin account. The investor sells those borrowed instruments to repurchase them when the price drops, hoping to profit from the decline. When a bearish investor incorrectly identifies the timing of the decrease in price, the risk of getting caught in a bear trap increases.
