<AIContent content={`<h2>Tender Offer</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A tender offer is a bid to purchase some or all of a company's stock. Typically, this acquisition is conducted publicly and invites shareholders to sell their shares at a specific price and within a specific time window. The offered price is usually higher than the market price and often depends on a minimum or maximum limit of the number of shares to be sold.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of a tender offer originated in the mid-20th century. With the development of capital markets and the increase in corporate mergers and acquisitions, this method of acquisition gradually became a common means of corporate takeover. Key events include several large-scale mergers and acquisitions in the 1970s and 1980s, which promoted the popularity of tender offers globally.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Tender offers can be divided into two main categories: cash offers and exchange offers. A cash offer involves the acquirer purchasing the target company's shares with cash. An exchange offer involves the acquirer offering securities or other non-cash alternatives in exchange for the target company's shares. The characteristic of a cash offer is its directness and simplicity, making it easily acceptable to shareholders. An exchange offer may involve complex valuation and negotiation processes but can reduce the acquirer's cash outlay.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: In 2008, Microsoft Corporation launched a cash tender offer for Yahoo! Inc., offering $31 per share, totaling approximately $44.6 billion. Although Microsoft's offer was higher than Yahoo's market price at the time, Yahoo's board believed the offer undervalued the company and ultimately rejected the tender.</p><p>Case 2: In 2015, Royal Dutch Shell launched an exchange tender offer for BG Group. Shell offered a combination of cash and stock, with a total value of approximately $70 billion. This acquisition was successfully completed, significantly expanding Shell's presence in the natural gas market.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why is the tender offer price usually higher than the market price?<br/>Answer: The tender offer price is usually higher than the market price to attract shareholders to sell their shares and ensure the success of the acquisition.</p><p>2. Are shareholders required to accept a tender offer?<br/>Answer: Shareholders can choose to accept or reject a tender offer, depending on their satisfaction with the offer price and conditions.</p>`} id={101078} />
