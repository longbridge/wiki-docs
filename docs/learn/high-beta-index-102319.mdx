<p>The High Beta Index refers to a market index composed of stocks with high Beta values. Beta is a measure of a stock's or portfolio's volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a Beta value higher than 1 are considered high Beta stocks, indicating they are more volatile than the market average. The High Beta Index aims to reflect the performance of the most volatile stocks in the market, making it suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance, especially those looking to capitalize on market fluctuations for higher returns. The S&amp;P 500 High Beta Index is the most well-known of these indexes. It tracks the performance of 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that are the most sensitive to changes in market returns.</p>
