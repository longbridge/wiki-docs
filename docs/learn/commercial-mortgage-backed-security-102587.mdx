Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are fixed-income investment products that are backed by mortgages on commercial properties rather than residential real estate. CMBS can provide liquidity to real estate investors and commercial lenders alike.Because there are no rules for standardizing the structures of CMBS, their valuations can be difficult. The underlying securities of CMBS may include a number of commercial mortgages of varying terms, values, and property typesâ€”such as multi-family dwellings and commercial real estate. CMBS can offer less of a pre-payment risk than residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as the term on commercial mortgages is generally fixed.
