<p>Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator used to measure the price movements of stocks or other financial assets. It calculates a value between 0 and 100 based on the ratio of the magnitude of stock price increases and decreases over a certain period of time, and is used to determine the market's overbought and oversold conditions. Generally, an RSI value above 70 indicates that the asset may be overbought and could be due for a price correction, while an RSI value below 30 suggests that the asset may be oversold and could be due for a price rebound.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator used to measure the price movements of stocks or other financial assets. It calculates a value between 0 and 100 based on the ratio of the stock's gains and losses over a certain period, used to determine overbought and oversold conditions in the market. Generally, when the RSI value exceeds 70, it indicates that the asset may be overbought and the price might pull back; when the RSI value is below 30, it indicates that the asset may be oversold and the price might rebound.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> RSI was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in 1978 and first described in his book 'New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.' Wilder designed RSI to help traders identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market, enabling them to make more informed trading decisions.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> RSI mainly has two calculation periods: short-term (e.g., 9 days or 14 days) and long-term (e.g., 25 days or 50 days). Short-term RSI is more sensitive and suitable for short-term traders, while long-term RSI is smoother and suitable for long-term investors. Characteristics of RSI include: 1. Simplicity: It can be calculated with a single formula; 2. Intuitiveness: The value ranges from 0 to 100, making it easy to understand; 3. Versatility: It can be used for different markets and assets.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A stock has been rising continuously over the past 14 days, and the RSI value reaches 75. A trader might consider the stock overbought and decide to sell to lock in profits. Case 2: Another stock has been falling continuously over the past 14 days, and the RSI value drops to 25. A trader might consider the stock oversold and decide to buy in anticipation of a rebound.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is RSI always accurate? RSI is not always accurate; it is just a reference indicator and should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools. 2. How to choose the RSI period? The choice of period depends on the trader's strategy; short-term traders usually choose shorter periods, while long-term investors choose longer periods.</p>`} id={196} />
