<p>The term debt ratio refers to a financial ratio that measures the extent of a company’s leverage. The debt ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to total assets, expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt. A ratio greater than 1 shows that a considerable amount of a company's assets are funded by debt, which means the company has more liabilities than assets.&nbsp;</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The debt ratio is a financial ratio that measures a company's leverage. It is defined as the ratio of total debt to total assets, expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that most of the company's assets are financed by debt, meaning the company's liabilities exceed its assets.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the debt ratio originated in the early 20th century and became widely used with the development of modern corporate financial management theories. The earliest related studies can be traced back to the 1920s when economists began to focus on corporate capital structure and its impact on financial health.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The debt ratio can be further divided into short-term debt ratio and long-term debt ratio.<ul><li><strong>Short-term debt ratio:</strong> This is the ratio of short-term debt to total assets, reflecting the company's ability to repay debt in the short term.</li><li><strong>Long-term debt ratio:</strong> This is the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, reflecting the company's long-term financial stability.</li></ul>A high debt ratio usually indicates that the company is taking on higher financial risk, but it may also suggest that the company is leveraging for expansion.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company has total assets of 10 million yuan and total debt of 6 million yuan, resulting in a debt ratio of 0.6 or 60%.
