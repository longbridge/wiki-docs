The term cheapest to deliver (CTD) refers to the cheapest security delivered in a futures contract to a long position to satisfy the contract specifications. It is relevant only for contracts that allow a variety of slightly different securities to be delivered.This is common in Treasury bond futures contracts, which typically specify that any treasury bond can be delivered so long as it is within a certain maturity range and has a certain coupon rate. The coupon rate is the rate of interest a bond issuer pays for the entire term of the security.
