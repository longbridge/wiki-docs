Foundation and structure; 2. Roof and exterior walls; 3. Electrical systems; 4. Plumbing systems; 5. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; 6.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A home inspection is a comprehensive assessment of a property's structure, systems, and overall condition conducted by a professional home inspector before purchasing a home. The purpose of a home inspection is to identify potential issues with the property so that buyers can make informed decisions before purchasing. The inspection typically includes, but is not limited to, the foundation and structure, roof and exterior walls, electrical system, plumbing system, HVAC system, and interior facilities and appliances.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of home inspection originated in the mid-20th century in the United States. As the real estate market developed, buyers became increasingly concerned about the quality of homes. In the 1970s, the home inspection industry began to standardize, with the establishment of professional home inspectors and related associations, such as the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI).</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Home inspections can be categorized into several types, including pre-purchase home inspections, pre-sale home inspections, and new construction home inspections. Pre-purchase home inspections are the most common type, aimed at helping buyers understand the true condition of the property. Pre-sale home inspections are conducted by sellers before listing the property to identify and fix issues in advance. New construction home inspections ensure that newly built homes meet building codes and standards.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Mr. Zhang hired a professional home inspector before purchasing a second-hand house. The inspection revealed roof leaks and electrical system safety hazards. Mr. Zhang renegotiated the price with the seller and requested repairs based on the findings. Case 2: Ms. Li planned to sell her house and conducted a pre-sale home inspection to avoid issues during the transaction. The inspection revealed that the plumbing system needed repairs. Ms. Li promptly fixed the issues and successfully completed the sale.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How long does a home inspection take? It typically takes 2-4 hours, depending on the size and condition of the property. 2. How to verify the qualifications of a home inspector? Check if they hold relevant certifications, such as the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) certification. 3. Can a home inspection identify all issues? While a home inspection can identify most issues, some hidden problems may not be detected due to the limitations of the inspection.</p>`} id={100421} />
