A floating rate fund is a fund that invests in financial instruments that pays a variable or floating interest rate. A floating rate fund, which can be a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF), invests in bonds and debt instruments whose interest payments fluctuate with an underlying interest rate level. Typically, a fixed-rate investment will have a stable, predictable income. However, as interest rates rise, fixed-rate investments lag behind the market since their returns remain fixed.Floating rate funds aim to provide investors with a flexible interest income in a rising rate environment. As a result, floating-rate funds have gained in popularity as investors look to boost the yield of their portfolios.
