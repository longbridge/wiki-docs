<p>In finance, a haircut has two meanings. A haircut is most commonly used when referencing the percentage difference between an asset's market value and the amount that can be used as collateral for a loan. There is a difference between these values because market prices change over time, and the lender factors this fluctuation into their valuation and analysis for risk mitigation.</p><p>For example, if a person needs a $10,000 loan and wants to use their $10,000 stock portfolio as collateral, the bank is more likely to recognize the $10,000 portfolio as worth only $5,000 in collateral. The $5,000 or 50% reduction in the asset's value, for collateral purposes, is called the haircut. Should the person's stock portfolio decline in value, they may still have sufficient collateral for the amount of debt issued.</p><p>The term haircut is less commonly used as the market maker's spread. The term haircut is used since the market maker's spreads are so thin. A market maker may "trim" a very small fee off of proceeds collected as part of providing liquidity in markets or facilitating trades.</p>
