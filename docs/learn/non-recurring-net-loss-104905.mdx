Non-recurring net loss refers to the net loss caused by non-routine gains and losses that occur during the daily operations of a company. These non-recurring gains and losses may include one-time income or expenses, such as unconventional business income or expenses, gains or losses from asset disposal, etc. Non-recurring net loss usually does not reflect the normal operating condition of a company and needs to be excluded in order to more accurately evaluate the company's profitability.
