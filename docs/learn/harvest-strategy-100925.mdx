A harvest strategy is a marketing and business strategy that involves a reduction or a termination of investments in a product, product line, or line of business so that the entities involved can reap—or, harvest—the maximum profits. A harvest strategy is typically employed toward the end of a product's life cycle when it is determined that further investment will no longer boost product revenue.
