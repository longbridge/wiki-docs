The volatility ratio is a technical measure used to identify price patterns and breakouts. In technical analysis, it uses true range to gain an understanding of how a securityâ€™s price is moving on the current day in comparison to its past volatility.There are several different versions of volatility ratios, the most common being adaptations of average true range (ATR).
