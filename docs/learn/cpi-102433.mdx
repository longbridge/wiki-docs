<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an index that measures changes in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services that may include transportation, food and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. The CPI is one of the main indicators used to measure inflation. Generally, inflation above 3% is considered noticeable, and above 5% as relatively severe. CPI is often an important reference indicator for market economic activities and governmental monetary policy.</p>
