Kenney rule refers to a ratio that sets a target of unearned premiums to an insurer's policyholdersâ€™ surplus of 2-to-1. Developed by Roger Kenney, it helps determine and reduce the risk of an insurance company's insolvency. The rule is commonly used by companies that write property and casualty insurance. Regulators can use the Kenney rule to an insurer's ability to pay out claims and remain solvent.
