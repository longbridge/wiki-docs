Front-running is trading stock or any other financial asset by a broker who has inside knowledge of a future transaction that is about to affect its price substantially. A broker may also front-run based on insider knowledge that their firm is about to issue a buy or sell recommendation to clients that will almost certainly affect the price of an asset.This exploitation of information that is not yet public is illegal and unethical in almost all cases. Front-running isÂ also called tailgating.
