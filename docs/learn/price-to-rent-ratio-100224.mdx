<p>The price-to-rent ratio is the ratio of annualized rent to the price of house property. The formula is:</p><p style={{marginLeft:"40px"}}>Price-to-rent ratio = monthly rental / housing price</p><p>This ratio is an international index used to evaluate the return on investment of purchasing real estate for rent, and to judge whether the real estate market is reasonably priced or whether there is a froth. The international standard is usually 1 : 200 to 1 : 300. The higher the ratio, the greater the investment value of the house.</p>
