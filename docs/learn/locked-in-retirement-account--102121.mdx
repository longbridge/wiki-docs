<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>A Locked-In Retirement Account (LIRA) is a type of retirement savings account designed specifically for Canadian employees to manage and preserve funds transferred from a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or an employer pension plan. The funds in a LIRA are strictly restricted before retirement and generally cannot be withdrawn early. The purpose of this account is to ensure that employees have sufficient funds to support their living expenses during retirement.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of LIRA originated in Canada to address the issue of employees lacking sufficient savings for retirement. As the social security system improved and people demanded a higher quality of life in retirement, LIRA gradually became an important retirement savings tool. Its history dates back to the late 20th century when the Canadian government began implementing policies to encourage individuals and businesses to save for employees' retirement.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Locked Funds:</strong> The funds in a LIRA are strictly restricted before retirement and generally cannot be withdrawn early.<br/>2. <strong>Transfer of Funds:</strong> Primarily used to transfer funds withdrawn from RRSPs or employer pension plans (such as Registered Pension Plans, RPPs).<br/>3. <strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> LIRA enjoys tax deferral benefits similar to RRSPs, where funds within the account are not subject to income tax until withdrawal.<br/>4. <strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> LIRA helps employees save for retirement, ensuring they have sufficient funds to support their living expenses during retirement.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case One:</strong> Suppose an employee withdraws funds from their employer's pension plan and transfers these funds into a LIRA.

Additionally, the funds in the LIRA enjoy tax deferral benefits as they grow, only being subject to income tax upon withdrawal.<br/>2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> Another employee transfers funds from their RRSP to a LIRA upon leaving their job. Due to the locked-in nature of the LIRA, these funds cannot be withdrawn before retirement, ensuring the employee has sufficient funds to support their living expenses during retirement. Meanwhile, the funds continue to grow within the LIRA, enjoying tax deferral benefits.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Can I withdraw funds from my LIRA before retirement?</strong><br/>Generally, funds in a LIRA cannot be withdrawn before retirement unless specific exceptions are met, such as severe financial hardship or health issues.<br/>2. <strong>What are the tax benefits of a LIRA?</strong><br/>LIRA accounts enjoy tax deferral benefits, meaning the funds within the account are not subject to income tax until withdrawal.</p>`} id={102121} />
