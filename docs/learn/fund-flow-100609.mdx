Fund flow is the cash that flows into and out of various financial assets for specific periods of time. It's usually measured on a monthly or quarterly basis.Fund flow doesn't measure the performance of any single asset but emphasizes how cash is moving. For example, with mutual funds, fund flow measures the cash involved in share purchases or inflows and the cash resulting from share redemptions or outflows. It doesn't say anything about how well or badly a fund performed.Net inflow occurs when more cash flows into, say, the mutual fund than out of it. A net inflow creates excess cash for managers to invest. Theoretically, this then creates demand for securities such as stocks and bonds. A net outflow would indicate that more cash was taken from the mutual fund than was invested in it.
