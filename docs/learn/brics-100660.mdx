The term BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The coin was initially created as BRIC (without South Africa) by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill in 2001, claiming that by 2050 the four BRIC economies would come to dominate the global economy. South Africa was added to the list in 2010. The BRICS countries operate as a loose organization that seeks to further economic cooperation amongst member nations and increase their economic and political standing in the world.
