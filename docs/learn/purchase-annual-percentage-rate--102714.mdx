<p>A purchase annual percentage rate (APR) is the interest rate that your credit card issuer will charge you on purchases when you carry a balance on your card. In addition to purchase APRs, credit cards can have different APRs for cash advances and balance transfers. They may also have introductory APRs for a certain period after you sign up and penalty APRs for missing payments.</p>

It is a crucial indicator of the cost of using a credit card, typically expressed as an annual rate.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of APR originated in the mid-20th century as credit cards became more widespread. Financial institutions needed a standardized way to represent borrowing costs.
