<p>Predatory pricing is the illegal business practice of setting prices for a product unrealistically low in order to eliminate the competition.</p><p>Predatory pricing violates antitrust laws, as its goal is to create a monopoly. However, the practice can be difficult to prosecute. Defendants may argue that lowering prices is a normal business practice in a competitive market rather than a deliberate attempt to undermine the marketplace.</p><p>Predatory pricing doesnâ€™t always work, since the predator is losing revenue as well as the competition. The predator must raise prices eventually. At that point, new competitors will emerge.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Predatory pricing is an illegal business practice where a company sets its product prices extremely low to eliminate competitors. The goal is to force competitors out of the market in the short term, thereby achieving a monopoly position in the long term.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of predatory pricing dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, when large companies used low-price strategies to drive out smaller competitors, eventually forming monopolies. With the introduction of antitrust laws, this behavior was explicitly prohibited.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Predatory pricing can be divided into two main types: 1. Short-term predatory pricing, where prices are drastically reduced in a short period to quickly eliminate competitors; 2. Long-term predatory pricing, where a sustained low-price strategy is used to gradually weaken competitors' market positions. Its characteristics include: prices significantly below cost, clear and exclusionary intent, and severe disruption to the competitive market environment.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. In the 1990s, Walmart in the United States was accused of using predatory pricing strategies in certain regions, offering extremely low prices to undermine local small retailers and eventually dominate the market. 2. In the early 2000s, Carrefour in France was also sued for similar behavior, accused of selling certain products below cost to drive out competitors.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How is predatory pricing identified? It usually requires comparing prices to costs and examining the company's market behavior and intent. 2. Why is predatory pricing difficult to prosecute? Because companies can argue that their low-price strategy is a normal competitive market behavior rather than an intentional attempt to disrupt market competition.</p>`} id={101522} />
