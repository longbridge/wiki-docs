Predatory pricing is the illegal business practice of setting prices for a product unrealistically low in order to eliminate the competition.Predatory pricing violates antitrust laws, as its goal is to create a monopoly. However, the practice can be difficult to prosecute. Defendants may argue that lowering prices is a normal business practice in a competitive market rather than a deliberate attempt to undermine the marketplace.Predatory pricing doesnâ€™t always work, since the predator is losing revenue as well as the competition. The predator must raise prices eventually. At that point, new competitors will emerge.
