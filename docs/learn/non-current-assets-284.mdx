<p>Non-current assets are assets held by a company that are expected to be used for more than one year and are not easily converted into cash. These assets are typically used in the company's operations and include items such as property, plant, and equipment (PPE), intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks), and long-term investments (e.g., equity investments, bonds). Non-current assets are a significant component of a company's balance sheet, reflecting its long-term investment and growth potential.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-current assets refer to assets held by a company that are expected to be used for more than one year. These assets are not easily liquidated and are typically used in production and business activities. Non-current assets include fixed assets (such as land, buildings, machinery), intangible assets (such as patents, trademarks), and long-term investments (such as long-term equity investments, bond investments). Non-current assets occupy an important position in a company's balance sheet, reflecting the company's long-term investments and future development potential.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-current assets originates from the classification methods in accounting. In the late 19th century, with the development of the Industrial Revolution, the asset structure of enterprises became more complex, and traditional asset classification methods could no longer meet the needs of enterprise management and financial reporting. Thus, the concept of non-current assets gradually formed and was widely applied in corporate accounting practices in the early 20th century.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-current assets are mainly divided into the following categories:<br/>1. Fixed Assets: Includes land, buildings, machinery, etc. These assets usually have a long useful life and play a key role in the company's production and operations.<br/>2. Intangible Assets: Includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc. These assets, although not physical, have significant economic value and legal protection.<br/>3. Long-term Investments: Includes long-term equity investments, bond investments, etc. These investments usually have a long holding period and aim to obtain long-term returns.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. A manufacturing company purchases a piece of land to build a new factory. This land and factory are considered fixed assets with an expected useful life of over 20 years.<br/>2. A tech company acquires a patent to develop a new product. This patent is considered an intangible asset with an expected useful life of 10 years.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. Can non-current assets be liquidated at any time?<br/>Answer: Non-current assets are generally not easily liquidated as they are primarily used for the company's long-term production and business activities.<br/>2. How are depreciation and amortization of non-current assets calculated?<br/>Answer: Fixed assets typically use the straight-line method or accelerated depreciation method for depreciation, while intangible assets are amortized based on their useful life.</p>`} id={284} />
