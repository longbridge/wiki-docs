<p>A Bullet Bond is a type of bond where the issuer repays the principal in a single lump sum at maturity, rather than in installments over the bond's life. Typically, such bonds pay periodic interest (coupon payments) until maturity, at which point the entire principal is paid back. The advantage of bullet bonds is that bondholders receive a steady stream of interest income and can anticipate a single large payment of the principal at the end of the term. These bonds are suitable for investors who prefer not to receive principal repayments in installments but rather in a single payment at maturity.</p>
