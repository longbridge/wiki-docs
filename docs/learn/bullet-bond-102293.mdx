A bullet bond is a debt investment whose entire principal value is paid in one lump sum on its maturity date, rather than amortized over its lifetime. Bullet bonds cannot be redeemed early by their issuer, which means they are non-callable.Bullet bonds issued by stable governments typically pay a relatively low rate of interest due to the negligible risk that the lender will default on that lump sum payment. A corporate bullet bond may have to pay a higher interest rate if the corporation has a less-than-stellar credit rating.In any case, bullet bonds generally pay less than comparable callable bonds because the bullet bond does not give the lender the option of buying it back if interest rates change.
