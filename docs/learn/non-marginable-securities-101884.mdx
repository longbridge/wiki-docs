<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-marginable securities are those that cannot be purchased on margin at specific brokers or financial institutions. They must be fully funded by the investor's cash. Most brokerage firms have an internal list of non-marginable securities, which investors can find online or by contacting their institution. These lists are adjusted over time to reflect changes in stock prices and volatility. Holding non-marginable securities is unrelated to an investor's margin buying power.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-marginable securities originated from the regulatory need to protect investors from the risks of excessive leverage trading. As financial markets evolved, regulators recognized the high-risk nature of certain securities and established rules requiring these securities to be purchased with full cash.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-marginable securities mainly include the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Small-cap stocks:</strong> Due to their high price volatility, small-cap stocks are often classified as non-marginable securities.</li><li><strong>Newly listed stocks:</strong> Newly listed stocks lack historical trading data and are considered high-risk, thus often classified as non-marginable securities.</li><li><strong>High-volatility stocks:</strong> Stocks with significant price fluctuations are typically deemed high-risk and cannot be purchased on margin.</li></ul>The main characteristic of these securities is that they must be purchased with full cash, not through borrowed funds, thereby reducing the investor's leverage risk.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> An investor wishes to purchase shares of a newly listed company.

Therefore, any additional purchases must be made with cash, not margin.</li></ul>These cases illustrate the practical application of non-marginable securities, helping investors understand their limitations and requirements.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why are certain stocks classified as non-marginable securities?</strong> These stocks typically have high-risk characteristics, such as high volatility or lack of historical trading data. Regulators and brokers require these stocks to be purchased with full cash to protect investors.</li><li><strong>How can I check if a stock is a non-marginable security?</strong> Investors can check this information on their broker's website or by directly contacting their broker's customer service.</li></ul>These answers help investors better understand the regulations and methods for checking non-marginable securities.</p>`} id={101884} />
