Mothballing is the deactivation and preservation of equipment or a production facility for possible future use or sale. It can also mean the setting aside of an object or idea for possible reuse or revisiting in the future. Mothballing is common with expensive capital goods, machinery, aircraft, ships, properties, and other assets that are costly to create, have long useful lives, and may be subject to unpredictable market disruptions.
