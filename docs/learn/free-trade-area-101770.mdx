A free trade area is a region in which a number of countries have signed a free trade agreement and maintain little or no barriers to trade in the form of tariffs or quotas among one another. Free trade areas facilitate international trade and the associated gains from trade along with the international division of labor and specialization, but they have been criticized for costs that are associated with increasing economic integration and for artificially restraining free trade.
