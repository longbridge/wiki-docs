An imperfect market refers to any economic market that does not meet the rigorous standards of the hypothetical perfectly—or purely—competitive market. Pure or perfect competition is an abstract, theoretical market structure in which a series of criteria are met. Since all real markets exist outside of the spectrum of the perfect competition model, all real markets can be classified as imperfect markets.In an imperfect market, individual buyers and sellers can influence prices and production, there is no full disclosure of information about products and prices, and there are high barriers to entry or exit in the market.A perfect market is characterized by perfect competition, market equilibrium, and an unlimited number of buyers and sellers.
