Triangular arbitrage is the result of a discrepancy between three foreign currencies that occurs when the currency's exchange rates do not exactly match up. These opportunities are rare, and traders who take advantage of them usually have advanced computer equipment and/or programs to automate the process.A trader employing triangular arbitrage, for example, could make the following series of exchanges—USD to EUR to GBP to USD using the EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and USD/GDP rates, and (assuming low transaction costs) net a profit.
