Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in the consumption of a product in relation to a change in its price. Expressed mathematically, it is:Economists use price elasticity to understand how supply and demand for a product change when its price changes. Like demand, supply also has an elasticity, known as price elasticity of supply. Price elasticity of supply refers to the relationship between change in supply and change in price. Itâ€™s calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity supplied by the percentage change in price. Together, the two elasticities combine to determine what goods are produced at what prices.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Price Elasticity of Demand</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of a product changes in response to a change in its price. It quantifies the sensitivity of demand to price changes. Mathematically, it is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of price elasticity of demand was first introduced by 19th-century economist Alfred Marshall. He elaborated on this concept in his book 'Principles of Economics' and applied it to analyze market behavior.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Price elasticity of demand can be categorized as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Elastic Demand:</strong> When a 1% change in price leads to a more than 1% change in quantity demanded. This typically occurs with luxury or non-essential goods.</li><li><strong>Inelastic Demand:</strong> When a 1% change in price leads to a less than 1% change in quantity demanded. This usually happens with essential goods or goods with no substitutes.</li><li><strong>Unitary Elastic Demand:</strong> When a 1% change in price leads to exactly a 1% change in quantity demanded.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose the price of a luxury watch brand increases by 10%, resulting in a 20% decrease in its sales. This indicates that the demand for the watch is elastic because the change in quantity demanded is greater than the change in price.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Suppose the price of tap water in a city increases by 10%, but the quantity demanded only decreases by 2%. This indicates that the demand for tap water is inelastic because the change in quantity demanded is less than the change in price.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why do some goods have higher price elasticity of demand?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Typically, luxury goods, non-essential goods, or goods with many substitutes have higher price elasticity of demand because consumers can easily switch to other alternatives.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> How does price elasticity of demand affect a company's pricing strategy?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Companies need to consider price elasticity of demand when setting prices. If the demand for a product is elastic, increasing the price may lead to a decrease in revenue; if the demand is inelastic, the company can increase revenue by raising prices.</p>`} id={102436} />
