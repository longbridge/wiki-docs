<p>An anti-dilution provision is a protective mechanism typically included in the terms of a company's stock issuance to safeguard the interests of existing shareholders, particularly early investors and founders, from dilution of their ownership percentage due to subsequent issuance of new shares. There are various forms of anti-dilution provisions, with the most common being "Full Ratchet" and "Weighted Average." The Full Ratchet provision allows existing shareholders to purchase additional shares at the new, lower issuance price if the company issues new shares at a price lower than the previous issuance price, thereby maintaining their ownership percentage. The Weighted Average provision adjusts the existing shareholders' share price to reflect the impact of the new share issuance, thereby reducing the dilution effect. Anti-dilution provisions are particularly common in venture capital and private equity investments.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Anti-dilution clauses are protective mechanisms typically included in stock issuance terms to safeguard the interests of existing shareholders (especially early investors and founders) from dilution of their ownership percentage due to subsequent stock issuances by the company. There are various forms of anti-dilution clauses, with Full Ratchet and Weighted Average being the most common.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of anti-dilution clauses originated in the venture capital and private equity sectors to protect the interests of early investors. As startup financing activities increased, this clause became a standard term in investment agreements. Early anti-dilution clauses can be traced back to the mid-20th century when venture capital began to rise in the United States.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Anti-dilution clauses are mainly divided into two categories: Full Ratchet and Weighted Average.<ul><li><strong>Full Ratchet:</strong> If the company issues new shares at a price lower than the previous issuance price, existing shareholders can purchase additional shares at the new price to maintain their ownership percentage. This method offers the most protection to existing shareholders but is less favorable to new investors.</li><li><strong>Weighted Average:</strong> Adjusts the holding price of existing shareholders to reflect the impact of the new share issuance, thereby reducing the dilution effect. Weighted Average can be further divided into Broad-Based Weighted Average and Narrow-Based Weighted Average, with the former being more favorable to existing shareholders and the latter striking a balance between existing shareholders and new investors.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case One:</strong> A startup company A issued 100,000 shares at $10 per share in the first round of financing. Later, the company issued 50,000 new shares at $5 per share in the second round of financing. If a Full Ratchet clause is applied, first-round investors can purchase additional shares at $5 per share to maintain their ownership percentage.</li><li><strong>Case Two:</strong> For the same company A, if a Weighted Average clause is applied, the holding price of first-round investors will be adjusted to a weighted average price, with the specific calculation depending on whether a Broad-Based or Narrow-Based Weighted Average is chosen. This method cannot completely avoid dilution but can mitigate the dilution effect to some extent.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question One:</strong> Will anti-dilution clauses affect the interest of new investors?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, especially Full Ratchet clauses may make new investors feel unfair as they bear a greater risk of dilution.</li><li><strong>Question Two:</strong> Are anti-dilution clauses applicable to all types of companies?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> They are mainly applicable to high-growth startups and companies requiring multiple rounds of financing, and are less commonly used by traditional companies.</li></ul></p>`} id={101363} />
