Total shareholder return (TSR) is a measure of financial performance, indicating the total amount an investor reaps from an investmentâ€”specifically, equities or shares of stock. To arrive at its total, usually expressed as a percentage, TSR factors in capital gains and dividends from a stock; it might also include special distributions, stock splits, and warrants. Whichever way it is calculated, TSR means the same thing: the sum total of what a stock has returned to those who invested in it.
