<p>Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is a key metric that measures the total returns generated by a company for its shareholders over a certain period. It includes both dividend income and capital gains. Specifically, TSR represents the total gains a shareholder receives from holding a company's stock over a specific period, including stock price appreciation and reinvested dividends. The formula for calculating TSR is:&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image_resized" style={{width:"41.99%"}}><img src="https://pub.lbkrs.com/social/2024/0/amb16JtR1vdiqZ4NM4EezgwDNj33SYXW.jpg"></figure><p>where P<sub>end</sub>​​ is the ending stock price, P<sub>begin​</sub> is the beginning stock price, and D is the total dividends paid during the period.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is a key metric that measures the total return a company generates for its shareholders over a certain period.

TSR provides a comprehensive reflection of the actual returns shareholders receive and is an important metric for investors to evaluate company performance.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong></p><p>The concept of TSR originated in the mid-20th century as capital markets developed and investors' need to evaluate company performance increased. Initially, TSR calculation methods were primarily used for large publicly traded companies and later extended to various types of enterprises. In the 1980s, with the advancement of computer technology, TSR calculations became more convenient and widespread.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong></p><p>TSR can be divided into two main categories: market price-based TSR and internal financial data-based TSR. Market price-based TSR better reflects market confidence and expectations for the company, while internal financial data-based TSR better reflects the company's actual operating conditions. Characteristics of TSR include:</p><ul><li>Comprehensiveness: TSR considers both stock price changes and reinvested dividend income.</li><li>Time Sensitivity: TSR calculations require a specific time period, and TSR can vary significantly over different periods.</li><li>Market Reflection: TSR can reflect market expectations for the company's future development.</li></ul><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong></p><p>Case 1: Suppose a company's stock price was $100 at the beginning of 2023 and $120 at the end of 2023, with dividends of $5 per share paid during the period. The TSR calculation for this company is:</p><p>TSR = (120 - 100 + 5) / 100 = 0.25, or 25%.</p><p>Case 2: Another company's stock price was $50 at the beginning of 2023 and $55 at the end of 2023, with dividends of $2 per share paid during the period. The TSR calculation for this company is:</p><p>TSR = (55 - 50 + 2) / 50 = 0.14, or 14%.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Does TSR fully reflect a company's operating conditions?</strong></p><p>While TSR is a comprehensive metric, it primarily reflects shareholder returns and does not fully represent a company's operating conditions. Investors should consider other financial metrics when using TSR to evaluate a company.</p><p>2. <strong>Is TSR calculation complex?</strong></p><p>TSR calculation is relatively simple, requiring only the beginning stock price, ending stock price, and total dividends paid during the period. However, in practice, the specifics of dividend reinvestment may need to be considered.</p>`} id={102325} />
