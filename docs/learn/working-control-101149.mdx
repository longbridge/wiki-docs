Working control occurs when a minority shareholder, or group of them, has enough voting power to influence or determine corporate policy. Working control exists in corporations with widely dispersed share ownership where no single individual has a majority interest, meaning ownership of 51% or more of the voting shares.In such cases, an individual shareholder with a 20% stake in a company often controls a large enough position to acquire working control. Other times, it requires a group of shareholders working in concert to exert power and wield influence over a company’s direction.
