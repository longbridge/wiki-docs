<p>Working Control refers to the ability to exert significant influence and control over a company's major decisions in corporate governance, even though a shareholder or a group of shareholders does not hold an absolute majority (more than 50% of the shares).&nbsp;</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Actual control refers to the ability of a shareholder or a group of shareholders to exert significant influence and control over major decisions of a company, even though they do not hold an absolute majority of the shares (i.e., more than 50%).</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of actual control originated from the development of corporate governance theory. As companies grew larger and shareholdings became more dispersed, it became difficult for a single shareholder to control a company through absolute majority ownership. Thus, the concept of actual control emerged, emphasizing control through relative holdings, alliances, agreements, and other means.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Actual control can be categorized into the following types:<br/>1. <strong>Relative Holding:</strong> Holding a significant but less than 50% share of the company, exerting control through voting rights at shareholder meetings.<br/>2. <strong>Alliance Control:</strong> Multiple shareholders form alliances or agreements to collectively hold enough shares to control the company.<br/>3. <strong>Management Control:</strong> The management team controls the company's operations and decisions through shareholding or other means.<br/>Each method has its characteristics: relative holding relies on voting results at shareholder meetings, alliance control requires high cooperation among shareholders, and management control depends on the management team's expertise and influence.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case 1:</strong> The largest shareholder B of company A holds 45% of the shares. Although not an absolute majority, B collaborates with other small shareholders to secure more than 50% of the voting rights at shareholder meetings, thus achieving actual control over the company.<br/>2. <strong>Case 2:</strong> The management team of company C holds 20% of the shares and reaches agreements with other minor shareholders to ensure support in major decisions, thereby achieving actual control over the company.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>What is the difference between actual control and absolute majority control?</strong> Actual control does not require holding more than 50% of the shares but is achieved through other means.<br/>2. <strong>How to identify actual control?</strong> It requires analyzing factors such as shareholder proportions, relationships among shareholders, and the corporate governance structure.</p>`} id={101149} />
