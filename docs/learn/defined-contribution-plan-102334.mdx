A defined contribution (DC) plan is a retirement plan that's typically tax-deferred, like a 401(k) or a 403(b), in which employees contribute a fixed amount or a percentage of their paychecks to an account that is intended to fund their retirements. In addition, the sponsor company can match a portion of employee contributions as an added benefit.These plans place restrictions that control when and how each employee can withdraw from these accounts without penalties.
