Return on net assets (RONA) is a measure of financial performance calculated as net profit divided by the sum of fixed assets and net working capital. Net profit is also called net income.The RONA ratio shows how well a company and its management are deploying assets in economically valuable ways; a high ratio result indicates that management is squeezing more earnings out of each dollar invested in assets. RONA is also used to assess how well a company is performing compared to others in its industry.
