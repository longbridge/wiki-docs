A floating interest rate is an interest rate that changes periodically. The rate of interest moves up and down, or "floats," reflecting economic or financial market conditions. Often, it moves in tandem with a particular index or benchmark, or with general market conditions.A floating interest rate can also be referred to as an adjustable or variable interest rate because it can vary over the term of a debt obligation.
