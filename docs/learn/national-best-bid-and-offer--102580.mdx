The National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) is a quote that reports the highest bid price and lowest ask (offered) price in a security, sourced from among all available exchanges or trading venues. The NBBO, therefore, represents the tightest composite bid-ask spread in a security.The Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation NMS requires brokers to trade at the best available ask and bid price when buying and selling securities for customers and guarantee at least the NBBO quoted price to its customers at the time of a trade.
