The actual fundraising ratio refers to the ratio between the actual amount of funds obtained by a company or institution during the fundraising process and the planned fundraising amount. This ratio can be used to evaluate the financing ability and effectiveness of a company or institution during the fundraising process. If the actual fundraising ratio is higher than the planned fundraising ratio, it indicates that the company or institution has obtained more funds than expected, which may indicate a higher level of confidence from investors. On the other hand, if the actual fundraising ratio is lower than the planned fundraising ratio, it may indicate that the company or institution is facing financing difficulties or a lack of confidence from investors.
