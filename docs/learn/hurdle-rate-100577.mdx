A hurdle rate is the minimum rate of return a project or investment must achieve before the manager or investor approves a predetermined condition. It allows companies to make important decisions on whether or not to pursue a specific project. The hurdle rate describes the appropriate compensation for the level of risk present—riskier projects generally have higher hurdle rates than those with less risk.The term is often used in private equity investing and hedge fund management. For example, in a private equity investment fund, the General Partner is only allowed to charge their performance fees (known as carried interest) if the Limited Partner's rate of return is at or above the hurdle rate, which is a predetermined minimum acceptable rate.
