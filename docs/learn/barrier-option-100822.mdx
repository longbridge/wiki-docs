A barrier option is a type of derivative where the payoff depends on whether or not the underlying asset has reached or exceeded a predetermined price.A barrier option can be a knock-out, meaning it expires worthless if the underlying exceeds a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the writer. It can also be a knock-in, meaning it has no value until the underlying reaches a certain price.
