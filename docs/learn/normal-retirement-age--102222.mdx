Full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which you can receive full retirement benefits from Social Security. It's also known as normal retirement age. Full retirement age varies depending on the year you were born. FRA is 66 years and two months for people born in 1955, and it gradually rises to 67 for those born in 1960 or later.Â Claiming benefits before you reach full retirement age decreases them permanently.
