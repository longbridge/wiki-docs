Unitranche debt or financing represents a hybrid loan structure that combines senior debt and subordinated debt into one loan, allowing banks to compete better against private debt funds. The borrower of this kind of debt typically pays an interest rate that falls in between the interest rates that each type of loan would command individually.Unitranche debt is typically used in institutional funding deals. It lets the borrower get funding from multiple parties, which can result in decreased costs from multiple issuances, allow for greater fundraising through a single deal process, and facilitate a faster acquisition in a buyout.
