Conflict theory, first developed by Karl Marx, is a theory that society is in a state of perpetual conflict because ofÂ competition for limited resources.Conflict theory holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than by consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with wealth and power try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless. A basic premise of conflict theory is that individuals and groups within society will work to try to maximize their own wealth and power.
