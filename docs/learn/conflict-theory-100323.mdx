<p>Conflict Theory is a sociological theory that posits that society is driven by conflict and competition between different groups. This theory emphasizes that the unequal distribution of power and resources is the primary driver of social change and development. Conflict theory was originally proposed by Karl Marx, who argued that the fundamental conflict in society is between the bourgeoisie (those who own the means of production) and the proletariat (the working class). Modern conflict theory has expanded this view to include conflicts between various social groups (such as race, gender, religion, etc.) as significant factors in social structure and change. Conflict theory highlights inequalities and oppression within social structures and suggests that social change often occurs through conflict and struggle.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Conflict theory is a sociological theory that views society as driven by conflicts and competition between different groups. This theory emphasizes that the unequal distribution of power and resources is the main driver of social change and development. Conflict theory was initially proposed by Karl Marx, who believed that the fundamental conflict in society is the struggle between the capitalist class (owners of production means) and the proletariat (workers). Modern conflict theory has expanded this view to include conflicts of interest between various social groups (such as race, gender, religion, etc.) as important factors in social structure and change. Conflict theory highlights inequalities and oppression within social structures and posits that social change often occurs through conflict and struggle.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The origin of conflict theory can be traced back to the 19th century with Karl Marx, who elaborated on class struggle in capitalist society in works like 'The Communist Manifesto' and 'Das Kapital.' Marx believed that historical development is driven by contradictions and conflicts within production relations. In the mid-20th century, conflict theory was further developed by sociologists like Max Weber and Lewis Coser, who expanded the theory to include more forms of social conflict.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Conflict theory can be divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Marxist Conflict Theory:</strong> Emphasizes economic base and class struggle, viewing the fundamental contradiction in capitalist society as the conflict between the capitalist class and the proletariat.</li><li><strong>Weberian Conflict Theory:</strong> Considers not only economic factors but also conflicts of power and status, viewing social stratification as multidimensional.</li><li><strong>Modern Conflict Theory:</strong> Expands the scope of conflict to include interest conflicts between various social groups such as race, gender, and religion.</li></ul><p>The common characteristic of these theories is the emphasis on inequality and power struggles in society, positing that social change is achieved through conflict and struggle.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1: The American Civil Rights Movement</strong><br/>In the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans in the United States fought for equal rights and social justice through protests, marches, and legal actions. This movement is a typical example of social conflict leading to legal and social change.</p><p><strong>Case 2: Workers' Strikes</strong><br/>During the Industrial Revolution, workers organized strikes and unions to demand better working conditions and wages. These conflicts prompted reforms by governments and businesses, improving workers' living conditions.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>Question 1: Does conflict theory only focus on negative impacts?</strong><br/>Conflict theory not only focuses on negative impacts in society but also emphasizes the social changes and progress achieved through conflict.</p><p><strong>Question 2: Is conflict theory applicable to all societies?</strong><br/>While conflict theory is very effective in explaining many social phenomena, not all social issues can be explained through conflict theory. Other sociological theories like functionalism and symbolic interactionism offer different perspectives.</p>`} id={100323} />
