Convertible notes are a type of hybrid financial instrument with characteristics of both bonds and stocks. Such notes can be converted into common stock under specific conditions. Note holders can choose to convert their notes into company stocks, thereby participating in the company's shareholder equity, or they can choose to maintain their note holding rights to receive the interest and principal return on the notes.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Convertible notes are hybrid financial instruments that possess characteristics of both bonds and stocks. Holders can convert them into common stock under specific conditions, enjoying shareholder rights, or retain the notes to receive interest and principal repayments.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of convertible notes first appeared in the early 20th century. As financial markets evolved and investor demands diversified, they became a significant financing tool. The 1980s and 1990s marked the peak development period for convertible notes, with many companies using them for financing.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Convertible notes mainly fall into two categories: mandatory convertible notes and optional convertible notes.<ul><li><strong>Mandatory Convertible Notes:</strong> Holders must convert the notes into stock under specific conditions, typically at maturity. These are suitable for companies seeking mandatory equity financing.</li><li><strong>Optional Convertible Notes:</strong> Holders can choose whether to convert the notes into stock, offering greater flexibility, suitable for investors who want to adapt to different market conditions.</li></ul>Characteristics of convertible notes include:<ul><li>Providing fixed interest income while having the potential for equity appreciation.</li><li>Conversion terms usually include conversion price, conversion ratio, and conversion period.</li><li>Lower risk, as holders can still receive interest and principal repayments if they do not convert to stock.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A tech company issues a batch of convertible notes, allowing holders to convert them into company stock at $50 per share within three years.
