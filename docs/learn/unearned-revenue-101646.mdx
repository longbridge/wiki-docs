Unearned revenue is money received by an individual or company for a service or product that has yet to be provided or delivered. It can be thought of as a "prepayment" for goods or services that a person or company is expected to supply to the purchaser at a later date. As a result of this prepayment, the seller has a liability equal to the revenue earned until the good or service is delivered. This liability is noted under current liabilities, as it is expected to be settled within a year.Unearned revenue is also referred to as deferred revenue and advance payments.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Unearned Revenue</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Unearned revenue refers to the funds received by an individual or company before delivering a service or product. It can be seen as a prepayment for goods or services that the individual or company is expected to provide at a later date. Due to this prepayment, the seller's liability equals the appearance of revenue until the goods or services are delivered. This liability is listed as a current liability because it is expected to be settled within a year. Unearned revenue is also known as deferred revenue and advance payments.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of unearned revenue originates from accounting, particularly in accrual accounting. Accrual accounting requires recognizing revenue and expenses when they occur, not when cash is actually received or paid. The concept of unearned revenue helps businesses more accurately reflect their financial position and performance in financial statements.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Unearned revenue mainly falls into two categories: service-based unearned revenue and product-based unearned revenue. Service-based unearned revenue typically appears in subscription services, maintenance contracts, or prepaid services, such as software subscriptions or gym memberships. Product-based unearned revenue is common in pre-sale goods or advance payments for products, such as pre-ordered books or electronics.</p><p>Characteristics:<ul><li>Liquidity: Unearned revenue is usually listed as a current liability because it is expected to be settled within a year.</li><li>Timing: Unearned revenue is converted into actual revenue after the related service or product is delivered.</li><li>Accounting Treatment: In accounting, unearned revenue needs to be recorded in a liability account until the service or product is delivered.</li></ul></p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A software company offers an annual subscription service, and customers pay for the entire year upfront. Although the company has received the payment, it is recorded as unearned revenue until the service is provided. As the service is delivered each month, the company gradually converts unearned revenue into actual revenue.</p><p>Case 2: An electronics company accepts pre-orders for a new product, and customers pay part or all of the amount in advance. Before the product is actually delivered, these advance payments are recorded as unearned revenue. After the product is delivered, unearned revenue is converted into actual revenue.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why is unearned revenue listed as a liability?<br/>Unearned revenue is listed as a liability because the company has not yet provided the corresponding service or product upon receiving the payment, thus it has an obligation to provide these services or products in the future.</p><p>2. How does unearned revenue affect financial statements?<br/>Unearned revenue is shown as a current liability on the financial statements until the related service or product is delivered and converted into actual revenue, which helps to more accurately reflect the company's financial position and performance.</p>`} id={101646} />
