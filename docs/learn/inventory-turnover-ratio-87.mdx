Inventory turnover ratio refers to the ratio of sales to average inventory within a certain period of time, which is used to measure the liquidity and operational efficiency of inventory. A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates a faster turnover speed of inventory and higher efficiency in fund utilization.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Inventory turnover ratio is the ratio of a company's sales to its average inventory over a certain period, used to measure the liquidity and operational efficiency of the inventory. A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates faster inventory turnover and higher capital utilization efficiency. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of inventory turnover ratio originated from early business management practices. With the rise of the industrial revolution and mass production, companies needed more effective inventory management to improve operational efficiency. In the early 20th century, Frederick Taylor, the father of scientific management, proposed systematic methods for managing inventory, and the inventory turnover ratio gradually became an important indicator of a company's operational efficiency.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Inventory turnover ratio can be divided into high turnover and low turnover categories. High turnover is typically seen in fast-moving consumer goods industries, such as food and beverages, indicating rapid sales and replenishment of inventory. Low turnover is common in durable goods industries, such as automobiles and appliances, where the inventory sales cycle is longer. The advantage of high turnover is strong liquidity, but it may lead to stockouts; the advantage of low turnover is sufficient inventory, but it involves higher capital occupation.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A supermarket has a cost of goods sold of 5 million yuan in a year and an average inventory of 1 million yuan, resulting in an inventory turnover ratio of 500/100=5. This means the supermarket's inventory turned over 5 times in a year. Case 2: An electronics company has a cost of goods sold of 20 million yuan in a year and an average inventory of 5 million yuan, resulting in an inventory turnover ratio of 2000/500=4. This indicates the company's inventory turned over 4 times in a year.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is a higher inventory turnover ratio always better? Not necessarily, as an excessively high inventory turnover ratio may lead to stockouts and affect sales. 2. How can the inventory turnover ratio be improved? It can be achieved by optimizing inventory management, increasing sales efficiency, and reducing inventory backlog. 3. Is the inventory turnover ratio applicable to all industries? Different industries have different standards for inventory turnover ratios, and analysis should be based on industry characteristics.</p>`} id={87} />
