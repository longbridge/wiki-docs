Inventory turnover ratio refers to the ratio of sales to average inventory within a certain period of time, which is used to measure the liquidity and operational efficiency of inventory. A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates a faster turnover speed of inventory and higher efficiency in fund utilization.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The inventory turnover ratio is the ratio of a company's sales to its average inventory over a certain period, used to measure the liquidity and operational efficiency of the company's inventory. A higher inventory turnover ratio indicates faster inventory turnover and higher efficiency in the use of funds. Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of inventory turnover ratio originated from early accounting and financial management practices, aimed at helping companies assess their inventory management efficiency. As modern business became more complex, this metric gradually became an important tool in corporate financial analysis.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Inventory turnover can be categorized into high turnover and low turnover. High turnover typically indicates good inventory management and smooth sales, while low turnover may suggest inventory buildup or sluggish sales. The advantage of high turnover is reduced inventory holding costs and improved fund utilization efficiency, but excessively high turnover may lead to inventory shortages, affecting sales. Low turnover might result in excessive capital being tied up, increasing inventory management costs.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: Walmart, as one of the largest retailers globally, maintains a high inventory turnover ratio. This is due to its efficient supply chain management and inventory control systems, allowing Walmart to quickly respond to market demands and reduce inventory buildup. Case 2: In contrast, traditional manufacturing companies like automobile manufacturers may experience lower inventory turnover ratios. This is because their product production cycles are long and market demand fluctuates significantly, making inventory management more complex.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face when analyzing inventory turnover include how to accurately calculate average inventory and how to compare the inventory turnover ratio with industry averages. Additionally, overly pursuing a high inventory turnover ratio may lead to supply chain strain, affecting the company's normal operations.</p>`} id={87} />
