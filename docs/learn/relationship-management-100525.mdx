The term relationship management refers to a strategy in which an organization maintains an ongoing level of engagement with its audience and supply chain. This management can occur between a business and its customers, which is called business to consumer [B2C], or between a business and other businesses, which is referred to as business to business [B2B]. Relationship management aims to create a partnership between an organization and its patrons, instead of viewing the relationship as merely transactional. This is done through sales, service, and the analysis of data.
