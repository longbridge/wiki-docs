Weighted is a description of adjustments to a figure to reflect different proportions or "weights" of components that make up that figure. A weighted average, for example, takes into account the proportional relevance of each component instead of measuring each individual component equally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted average that compares each security based on the stock's price relative to the sum of all the stocks' prices. The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index, on the other hand, are based on market capitalization, where each company is measured relative to its market value.Where the DJIA and Nasdaq indexes utilize weighting in their calculation to more closely approximate the effect that changing stock prices will have on the overall market, weighting can also be used to help evaluate the past and current prices of individual instruments through technical analysis.
