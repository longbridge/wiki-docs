Magic formula investing refers to a rules-based, disciplined investing strategy that teaches people a relatively simple and easy-to-understand method for value investing. It relies on quantitative screens of companies and stocks, and is designed to beat the stock market's average annual returns using the S&P 500 to represent the market return. Put simply, it works by ranking stocks based on their price and returns on capital.Magic formula investing tells you how to approach value investing from a methodical and unemotional perspective. Developed by Joel Greenblatt—an investor, hedge fund manager, and business professor—the formula applies to large-cap stocks but doesn't include any small or micro-cap companies.
