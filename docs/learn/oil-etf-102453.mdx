An oil ETF is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) which invests in companies engaged in the oil and gas industry. Companies featured in the ETF basket include discovery, production, distribution, and retail businesses as well as the commodity itself. Some oil ETFs may be commodity pools, with limited partnership interests instead of shares. These pools invest in derivative contracts such as futures and options.
