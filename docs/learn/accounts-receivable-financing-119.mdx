Accounts Receivable Financing refers to a method in which a company or individual obtains financing from financial institutions or other funding providers by using accounts receivable as collateral or guarantee. In accounts receivable financing, the company or individual sells the rights to their accounts receivable to the financing provider in order to meet short-term funding needs.
