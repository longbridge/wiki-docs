<AIContent content={`<h2>Graham Number</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The Graham Number (or Benjamin Graham Number) is a metric used to measure the intrinsic value of a stock by considering the company's earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS). It represents the upper limit of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for a stock. According to this theory, any stock price below the Graham Number is considered undervalued and thus worth investing in.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The Graham Number was introduced by Benjamin Graham, known as the 'father of value investing,' in his book 'The Intelligent Investor.' Graham's investment philosophy emphasizes evaluating a company's fundamentals to determine its intrinsic value, thereby identifying undervalued investment opportunities amidst market fluctuations.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The Graham Number is primarily used in defensive investment strategies, suitable for investors looking to maintain low risk in their investments. The calculation formula is:<br/><strong>Graham Number = √(22.5 × Earnings Per Share (EPS) × Book Value Per Share (BVPS))</strong></p><p>Characteristics:<ul><li>Simple to use: Requires only two financial metrics for calculation.</li><li>Conservative valuation: Provides a conservative upper limit for stock valuation, suitable for risk-averse investors.</li><li>Historically validated: Based on Graham's long-term investment experience and theory.</li></ul></p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose a company has an EPS of $2 and a BVPS of $20. The Graham Number for this company would be:<br/>Graham Number = √(22.5 × 2 × 20) = √(900) = $30.<br/>If the current stock price of the company is $25, then according to the Graham Number, the stock is considered undervalued and worth investing in.</p><p>Case 2: Another company has an EPS of $3 and a BVPS of $15. The Graham Number for this company would be:<br/>Graham Number = √(22.5 × 3 × 15) = √(1012.5) ≈ $31.8.<br/>If the current stock price of the company is $35, then according to the Graham Number, the stock is considered overvalued and not recommended for investment.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>1. Is the Graham Number applicable to all types of companies?</strong><br/>The Graham Number is mainly applicable to companies with stable earnings and clear book values. It may not be suitable for high-growth companies or those in emerging industries.</p><p><strong>2. Does the Graham Number guarantee investment success?</strong><br/>The Graham Number is merely a valuation tool and does not guarantee investment success. Investors should also consider other analysis methods and market conditions for a comprehensive judgment.</p>`} id={101404} />
