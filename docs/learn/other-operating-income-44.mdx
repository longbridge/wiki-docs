<p>Other operating income refers to various types of income that a company earns from activities that are not part of its primary business operations but are still related to its overall business activities. This income may include, but is not limited to, rental income, interest income, commission income, government grants, and gains from the sale of assets. Other operating income is typically listed on the income statement (profit and loss statement) and is often detailed in the notes to the financial statements.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other operating income refers to various types of income that a company earns outside of its main business activities but still related to its operations. This income may include, but is not limited to, rental income, interest income, commission income, government grants, and gains from the sale of assets. Other operating income is typically listed on the income statement and detailed in the notes to the financial statements.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of other operating income developed as the complexity of corporate financial reporting increased. As companies diversified their operations, financial statements needed to more accurately reflect various income sources. Thus, in the mid-20th century, financial reporting standards began to clearly distinguish between primary operating income and other operating income.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other operating income can be categorized into various types, including rental income, interest income, commission income, government grants, and gains from asset sales. These incomes are characterized by not being the core business income but still significantly impacting the company's financial status. Application scenarios include companies earning rental income from leasing idle assets or interest from investment products. The advantage is that it can increase the company's income sources, while the disadvantage is that these incomes are usually not sustainable or stable.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A real estate company earns rental income from leasing its idle office buildings, which is classified as other operating income. Case Study 2: A manufacturing company sells its idle equipment, and the gains are categorized as other operating income. These cases demonstrate how companies can increase income through non-core business activities.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues include distinguishing other operating income from main business income. Typically, other operating income comes from non-core business activities. A common misconception is mistaking one-time income for sustainable income. Investors should carefully read the notes to the financial statements to understand the nature of the income.</p>`} id={44} />
