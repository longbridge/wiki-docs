<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Paid-in capital refers to the total amount of capital that a company has received from shareholders in exchange for stock. It includes paid-in share capital and paid-in surplus, forming a crucial part of a company's capital structure and reflecting the actual funds received from shareholders.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of paid-in capital emerged with the development of joint-stock companies. The earliest joint-stock company can be traced back to the 17th century with the Dutch East India Company. As modern corporate systems evolved, paid-in capital became an important measure of a company's financial strength.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Paid-in capital is mainly divided into paid-in share capital and paid-in surplus. Paid-in share capital refers to the funds shareholders actually pay when a company issues stock. Paid-in surplus is the portion extracted from profits to strengthen capital. The characteristics of paid-in capital include its stability and long-term nature, as it represents shareholders' long-term investment in the company.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>For example, Alibaba, a large tech company, saw a significant increase in its paid-in capital during its IPO, reflecting investor confidence in its future growth. Another example is Apple Inc., which has optimized its paid-in capital structure through multiple stock issuances and buybacks, supporting its continuous innovation and market expansion.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often confuse paid-in capital with registered capital. Paid-in capital is the actual funds received, while registered capital is the legally registered amount. Additionally, an increase in paid-in capital usually indicates more shareholder support but may dilute existing shareholders' equity.</p>`} id={90} />
