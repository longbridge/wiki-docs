<p>A central bank's weapons for stimulating the economy may become ineffective if short-term interest rates are "zero-bound," or hit zero. At least, that is the conventional wisdom, but the assumption has been tested in the recent past and found faulty.</p><p>In three recent cases, a central bank's action in pushing interest rates below zero seemed to have had modest success, or at least not worsened the situation. In all three cases, the action was a response to a financial crisis.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Zero Interest Rate refers to the state where the central bank lowers short-term interest rates to zero. This means the cost of interbank lending is almost zero, aiming to stimulate economic activity by reducing borrowing costs.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) was first introduced by the Bank of Japan in the 1990s to combat economic stagnation and deflation. After the 2008 global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank also adopted this policy.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Zero Interest Rate Policy mainly falls into two categories: 1. Nominal Zero Interest Rate: where the nominal interest rate is zero. 2. Real Zero Interest Rate: where the real interest rate, adjusted for inflation, is close to zero. Characteristics include: lowering borrowing costs, stimulating consumption and investment, and potentially leading to asset price bubbles.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to near zero to stabilize financial markets and promote economic recovery. 2. In 2014, the European Central Bank lowered deposit rates to negative values to address low inflation and economic weakness in the Eurozone.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Will zero interest rates lead to inflation? Typically not, as zero interest rate policies are often used to combat deflation. 2. Will the zero interest rate policy be effective in the long term? Long-term use may lead to financial market imbalances and needs to be complemented with other policy tools.</p>`} id={100136} />
