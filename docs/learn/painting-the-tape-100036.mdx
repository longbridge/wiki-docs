Painting the tape is a form of market manipulation whereby market players attempt to influence the price of a security by buying andÂ selling it among themselves to create the appearance of substantial trading activity. The goal of painting the tape is to create the illusion of an increased interest in a stock to trick investors into buying shares, which would drive the price higher.
