A loan application fee is charged to a potential borrower for processing and underwriting an application for a loan, such as a mortgage or car loan. Loan application fees may be required for all types of loans and are intended to pay for the costs of the process of loan approval, but are considered by many observers to be unnecessary or overly costly.
