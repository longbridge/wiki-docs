An annualized total return is the geometric average amount of money earned by an investment each year over a given time period. The annualized return formula is calculated as a geometric average to show what an investor would earn over a period of time if the annual return was compounded.An annualized total return provides only a snapshot of an investment's performance and does not give investors any indication of its volatility or price fluctuations.
