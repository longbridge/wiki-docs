A retainer fee is an amount of money paid upfront to secure the services of a consultant, freelancer, lawyer, or other professional. A retainer fee is most commonly paid to third parties that the payer has engaged to perform a specific action on their behalf.These fees, almost always paid upfront, only ensure the receiver's commitment. In addition, retainer fees usually do not represent the total final cost of the services provided.
