The term contingent value right (CVR) refers to a right often granted to shareholders of a company facing restructuring or a buyout. These rights ensure that the shareholders get certain benefits if a specific event occurs, usually within a specified time frame. These rights are similar to options because they frequently have an expiration date, beyond which the rights to the additional benefits will not apply. CVRs are usually related to the performance of a company's stock.
