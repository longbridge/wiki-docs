Noncurrent liabilities, also called long-term liabilities or long-term debts, are long-term financial obligations listed on a companyâ€™s balance sheet. These liabilities have obligations that become due beyond twelve months in the future, as opposed to current liabilities which are short-term debts with maturity dates within the following twelve month period.
