A Veblen good is a good for which demand increases as the price increases due to its exclusive nature and appeal as a status symbol. This runs counter to the prevailing circumstance of demand falling as prices rise. Thus, a Veblen goodÂ has an upward-sloping demand curve rather than the typical downward-sloping curve.A Veblen good is generally a high-quality, coveted product. This stands in contrast to a Giffen good, which also has an upward-sloping curve but is a non-luxury product with no easily available substitutes.
