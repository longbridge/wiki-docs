Core FFO refers to a metric used by real estate investment trusts (REITs) to measure their operating performance. It represents the net income of REITs plus depreciation, amortization, and non-cash expenses. Core FFO is considered a more accurate and comparable measure as it excludes non-operating factors such as non-cash gains and expenses. It helps investors evaluate the profitability and cash flow situation of REITs.
