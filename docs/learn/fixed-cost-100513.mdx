Fixed cost refers to the cost of a business expense that doesn’t change even with an increase or decrease in the number of goods and services produced or sold. Fixed costs are commonly related to recurring expenses not directly related to production, such as rent, interest payments, insurance, depreciation, and property tax.Since fixed costs are not related to a company’s production of any goods or services, they are generally indirect. Shutdown points tend to be applied to reduce fixed costs. These costs are among two different types of business expenses that together result in their total costs. The other is called a variable cost.
