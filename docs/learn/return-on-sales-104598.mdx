The sales yield ratio refers to the ratio between a company's sales revenue and sales cost. It measures the profit generated by each unit of sales revenue. The sales yield ratio is an important financial indicator that can be used to evaluate a company's profitability. A higher sales yield ratio indicates that a company is able to generate profits at a lower cost, while a lower sales yield ratio may indicate higher costs or lower sales revenue.
