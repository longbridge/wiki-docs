<p>A Bullish Harami is a candlestick chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict potential market reversals. This pattern consists of two candlesticks: the first is a longer bearish candlestick, indicating a downward market trend, and the second is a shorter bullish candlestick that is completely contained within the body of the first candlestick. This pattern suggests that the selling pressure may be weakening, and buying interest is starting to emerge. The appearance of a Bullish Harami is often considered a potential buy signal, especially at the end of a downtrend. The validity of this pattern can be confirmed by using other technical indicators, such as volume, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and others.</p>
