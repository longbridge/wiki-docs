Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) is a component of Tier 1 capital that is primarily common stock held by a bank or other financial institution. CET1Â is a capital measure that was introduced in 2014 as a precautionary way to protect the economy from a financial crisis, largely in the context of the European banking system. All Eurozone banks are expected to meet the minimum CET1 ratio requirements to their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) as outlined by financial regulators.
