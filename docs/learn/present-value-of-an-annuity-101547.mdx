The present value of an annuity is the current value of future payments from an annuity, given a specified rate of return, or discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the annuity.Present value (PV) is an important calculation that relies on the concept of the time value of money, whereby a dollar today is relatively more "valuable" in terms of its purchasing power than a dollar in the future.
