The term employee stock option (ESO) refers to a type of equity compensation granted by companies to their employees and executives. Rather than granting shares of stock directly, the company gives derivative options on the stock instead. These options come in the form of regular call options and give the employee the right to buy the company's stock at a specified price for a finite period of time. Terms of ESOs will be fully spelled out for an employee in an employee stock options agreement.In general, the greatest benefits of a stock option are realized if a company's stock rises above the exercise price. Typically, ESOs are issued by the company and cannot be sold, unlike standard listed or exchange-traded options. When a stock’s price rises above the call option exercise price, call options are exercised and the holder obtains the company’s stock at a discount. The holder may choose to immediately sell the stock in the open market for a profit or hold onto the stock over time.

Ordinary income tax is due upon exercise, but only capital gains tax is due upon the sale of the stock.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> John works at a tech company that grants him 1,000 ESOs with an exercise price of $10 per share.

She chooses to hold onto these shares long-term, hoping for further price appreciation.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>1.
