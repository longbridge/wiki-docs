Depreciated cost is the value of a fixedÂ asset minus all of the accumulated depreciation that has been recorded against it. In a broader economic sense, the depreciated cost is the aggregate amount of capital that is "used up" in a given period, such as a fiscal year. The depreciated cost can be examined for trends in a company's capital spending and how aggressive their accounting methods are, seen through how accurately they calculate depreciation.Depreciated cost is also known as the "salvage value," "net book value," or "adjusted cost basis."
