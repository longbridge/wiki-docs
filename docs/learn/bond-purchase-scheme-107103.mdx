Bond purchase program refers to a policy tool used by central banks or other financial institutions to increase liquidity and promote economic growth by purchasing government bonds or other bonds. Bond purchase programs are usually used to stimulate the economy, lower interest rates, increase the money supply, and promote investment and consumption. By purchasing bonds, central banks can inject funds into the market, increase bank liquidity, reduce borrowing costs, and stimulate economic activities. Bond purchase programs can also be used to stabilize financial markets, reduce market volatility, and increase market confidence.
