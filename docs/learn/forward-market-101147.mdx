<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The forward market refers to a market where two parties agree to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date.

The underlying assets in the forward market can include foreign exchange, commodities, financial instruments, etc.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The origin of the forward market can be traced back to ancient agricultural societies, where farmers and merchants would agree on prices in advance to lock in future transactions and reduce the risk of price fluctuations.
