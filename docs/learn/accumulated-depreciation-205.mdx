<p>Accumulated depreciation refers to the total amount of depreciation expense that has been allocated to a fixed asset since it was put into use, according to the prescribed depreciation method. It reflects the value loss of the fixed asset due to wear and tear, aging, and other factors over its useful life. Accumulated depreciation is presented as a contra asset account on the balance sheet, reducing the gross book value of fixed assets to show their net book value.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Accumulated depreciation refers to the total amount of depreciation that a company has recorded for its fixed assets since they were put into use, according to the prescribed depreciation methods. It reflects the value loss of fixed assets transferred to product costs due to wear and tear, aging, etc., during their use. Accumulated depreciation is listed as a deduction item for fixed assets on the balance sheet, helping to reflect the net value of fixed assets.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of depreciation dates back to the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution when companies began to use machinery on a large scale and realized that these assets depreciate over time. To accurately reflect the financial status of a company, depreciation methods were introduced into accounting practices. With the development of accounting standards, accumulated depreciation has become an essential part of fixed asset management.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>There are several main methods of calculating accumulated depreciation:</p><ul><li><strong>Straight-Line Method:</strong> The same amount of depreciation is recorded each year, suitable for fixed assets with a long useful life and uniform value loss.</li><li><strong>Double Declining Balance Method:</strong> Higher depreciation amounts are recorded in the early years, decreasing over time, suitable for fixed assets with higher initial usage intensity.</li><li><strong>Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits Method:</strong> Depreciation rates are calculated based on the sum of the years of the asset's useful life, with higher depreciation in the early years and lower in the later years.</li></ul><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company purchases a machine worth 100,000 yuan with an expected useful life of 10 years, using the straight-line method for depreciation. The annual depreciation amount is 10,000 yuan, and the accumulated depreciation at the end of the 5th year is 50,000 yuan.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company purchases a transport vehicle worth 200,000 yuan with an expected useful life of 5 years, using the double declining balance method for depreciation. The first year's depreciation amount is 80,000 yuan, and the second year's is 48,000 yuan, with accumulated depreciation at the end of the 2nd year being 128,000 yuan.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Does accumulated depreciation affect a company's cash flow?<br/><strong>A:</strong> No. Accumulated depreciation is a non-cash expense in accounting and does not directly affect a company's cash flow.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can accumulated depreciation be adjusted arbitrarily?<br/><strong>A:</strong> No. The calculation of accumulated depreciation must follow accounting standards and the company's accounting policies and cannot be adjusted arbitrarily.</p>`} id={205} />
