A perpetual inventory system is based on an accounting method known as perpetual inventory, which continuously records inventory changes in real time with computerized point-of-sale systems, thereby removing the need for physical inventory checks. It provides a highly detailed view of changes in inventory with immediate reporting of the amount of inventory in stock, and it accurately reflects the level of goods on hand.Within this system, a company makes no effort to keep detailed inventory records of products on hand; instead, purchases of goods are recorded as a debit to the inventory database. A perpetual inventory system differs from a periodic inventory system, a method in which a company maintains records of its inventory by regularly scheduled physical counts.
