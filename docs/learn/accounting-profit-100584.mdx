<p>Accounting Profit, also known as Financial Profit or Book Profit, is the net income of a business for a specific accounting period, calculated according to accounting standards. It is derived by subtracting total expenses from total revenues and is typically reported in financial statements, particularly the income statement (profit and loss statement). Accounting profit includes all realized revenues and incurred expenses but excludes unrealized gains or potential losses. It reflects the financial performance and operational results of a business and is a crucial indicator for assessing profitability. Accounting profit differs from economic profit, which considers opportunity costs and implicit costs, whereas accounting profit is based solely on actual transactions recorded.</p><p><br/>&nbsp;</p>
