MENA is an acronym for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The region is typically considered to include around 19 countries, but the definition can be stretched to include up to 27. The World Bank includes 21 countries as part of MENA and based on their 2020 population reports, the region accounts for approximately 6% of the world's population.According to OPEC data, the MENA region holds more than half of the world's oil reserves, and two-fifths of the world's natural gas reserves. Due to the region's substantial petroleum and natural gas production, MENA is an important source of global economic and energy resources.
