Input-output analysis (I-O) is a form of macroeconomic analysis based on the interdependencies between different economic sectors or industries. This method is commonly used for estimating the impacts of positive or negative economic shocks and analyzing the ripple effects throughout an economy. I-O economic analysis was originally developed by Wassily Leontief (1906â€“1999), who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in this area.
