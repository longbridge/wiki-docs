<p>Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents a firm’s average after-tax cost of capital from all sources, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and other forms of debt. WACC&nbsp;is the average rate that a company expects to pay to finance its assets.WACC is a common way to determine required rate of return (RRR) because it expresses, in a single number, the return that both bondholders and shareholders demand to provide the company with capital. A firm’s WACC is likely to be higher if its stock is relatively volatile or if its debt is seen as risky because investors will require greater returns.</p>
