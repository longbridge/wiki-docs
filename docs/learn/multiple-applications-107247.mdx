Multiple filings refer to submitting application materials or forms multiple times within a certain time range. In the financial field, multiple filings usually refer to the need for enterprises or individuals to submit tax declaration forms to the tax authorities multiple times within the prescribed time period to fulfill their tax declaration obligations. Multiple filings can be due to taxpayers needing to declare multiple types of taxes or because there are multiple declaration deadlines for the same type of tax. Through multiple filings, tax authorities can regulate and verify taxpayers' tax payment situations.
