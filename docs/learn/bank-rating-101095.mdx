A bank rating refers to a letter or numerical grade assigned to banks and thrift institutions by rating agencies.Grades are assigned to provide the public with information about an organization's level of credit risk and financial safety and soundness. They also help bank leaders identify problems within their institution, if any, that need to be addressed.Many rating agencies use a proprietary formula to determine ratings while others use the CAMELS system to assess financial institutions.
