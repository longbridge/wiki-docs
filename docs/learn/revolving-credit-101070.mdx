Revolving credit is a credit line that remains available even as you pay the balance. Borrowers can access credit up to a certain amount and then have ongoing access to that amount of credit. They can repay the balance in full, or make regular payments. Each payment, minus the interest and fees charged, opens the credit again to the account holder.Examples of revolving credit include credit cards, lines of credit, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). They work differently than installment loans. Learn about the pros and cons of a revolving line of credit.
