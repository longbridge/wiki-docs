A qualified exchange accommodation arrangement is a tax strategy where a third party, known as the accommodation party, temporarily holds a real estate investor's relinquished or replacement property. Qualified exchange accommodation arrangements, while still subjecting investors to strict guidelines for the sale and purchase of like-kind properties, increase flexibility in the timing of sales, and simplify qualifications for the tax deferral.
