A residual dividend is a dividend policy used by companies whereby the amount of dividends paid to shareholders amounts to what profits are left over after the company has paid for its capital expenditures (CapEx) and working capital costs.Companies that use a residual dividend policy fund CapEx with available earnings before paying dividends to shareholders. This means the dollar amount of dividends paid to investors each year will vary.

Due to lower capital expenditures that year, the remaining profits were higher, leading to higher dividends for shareholders. However, in 2023, the company increased its capital expenditures, reducing the remaining profits and consequently the dividends.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Why would a company choose a residual dividend policy?<br/>Companies choose this policy to ensure sufficient funds for necessary capital expenditures, supporting long-term business growth.</li><li>How does the residual dividend policy affect shareholders?<br/>This policy may result in unstable dividend amounts for shareholders each year, but it supports the company's sustainable development in the long run.</li></ul></p>`} id={100896} />
