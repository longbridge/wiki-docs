"Without recourse" means that one party cannot obtain a judgment against, or reimbursement from, a defaulting or opposing party in a financial transaction. When the buyer of a promissory note or other negotiable instrument enters into a "no recourse" agreement, they assume the risk of default.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-recourse means that in a financial transaction, one party cannot sue or claim against the defaulting party. When an acceptor purchases a promissory note or other negotiable instrument, if they enter into a 'non-recourse' agreement, they assume the risk of default.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-recourse originated in medieval trade finance when merchants traded through notes. As financial markets evolved, this concept gradually developed and became widely used in modern financial transactions, especially in loans and securitization.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-recourse mainly falls into two categories: non-recourse loans and non-recourse notes.<ul><li><em>Non-recourse loans:</em> The lender can only rely on the collateral to recover the loan and cannot claim any shortfall from the borrower. These loans are commonly used in real estate and project financing.</li><li><em>Non-recourse notes:</em> The holder cannot claim against the issuer or endorser and can only rely on the credit of the note itself. These notes are common in trade finance.</li></ul>The main characteristic of non-recourse is risk transfer, meaning the risk is transferred from the lender or holder to the borrower or issuer.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><em>Case 1:</em> A real estate development company obtains a non-recourse loan from a bank to build a large commercial project. If the project fails, the bank can only recover the mortgaged real estate and cannot claim any shortfall from the development company.</li><li><em>Case 2:</em> An export company sells goods to a foreign customer and accepts a non-recourse note as payment. If the customer defaults, the export company can only rely on the credit of the note itself and cannot claim against the customer.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><em>Question 1:</em> Are the interest rates for non-recourse loans higher than those for recourse loans?<br/><em>Answer:</em> Generally, yes, because the lender assumes higher risk.</li><li><em>Question 2:</em> Are non-recourse notes suitable for all businesses?<br/><em>Answer:</em> No, they are suitable for businesses with strong credit, as the default risk is higher.</li></ul></p>`} id={101011} />
