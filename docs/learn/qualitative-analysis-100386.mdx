<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Qualitative analysis is a research method that focuses on the collection and interpretation of non-numeric data, aiming to understand the nature and complexity of phenomena. Unlike quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis does not rely on statistical data and numerical analysis but draws conclusions through the description, classification, and interpretation of non-numeric information. In the financial and business fields, qualitative analysis is often used to assess non-financial factors of a company or project.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The origin of qualitative analysis can be traced back to research methods in social sciences and humanities, which emphasize a deep understanding of human behavior and social phenomena. In the early 20th century, sociologists and anthropologists began using qualitative methods, such as interviews and observations, to study social phenomena. Over time, qualitative analysis was gradually introduced into the business and financial fields to evaluate non-numeric factors such as corporate culture, management quality, and market trends.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Qualitative analysis can be divided into several main types, including case studies, interviews, focus groups, and observations.<ul><li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> In-depth analysis of a single or a few cases, providing detailed background and contextual information.</li><li><strong>Interviews:</strong> In-depth conversations with respondents to gather their views and experiences.</li><li><strong>Focus Groups:</strong> Group discussions to collect multiple perspectives and interaction information.</li><li><strong>Observations:</strong> Direct observation of behaviors and environments to obtain first-hand data.</li></ul>Each method has its pros and cons. Case studies and interviews can provide in-depth information but may lack generalizability; focus groups and observations can offer diverse perspectives but may be influenced by observer bias.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Corporate Culture Assessment:</strong> An investment firm considering acquiring a target company uses qualitative analysis to evaluate the target company's corporate culture. Through interviews and observations, the investment firm discovers that the target company has a strong culture of innovation and high employee satisfaction, providing crucial non-financial information for the acquisition decision.</li><li><strong>Market Trend Analysis:</strong> A market research company uses qualitative methods such as focus groups and consumer interviews to understand the market acceptance of a new product. By collecting consumer feedback and opinions, the company can better adjust product design and marketing strategies.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Is qualitative analysis reliable?</strong> The reliability of qualitative analysis depends on the rigor of the research design and data collection methods. Although qualitative data may be subjective, its reliability can be enhanced through systematic methods and multiple data sources.</li><li><strong>How to combine qualitative and quantitative analysis?</strong> Qualitative and quantitative analyses can be used complementarily. Qualitative analysis provides in-depth understanding and contextual information, while quantitative analysis offers broad statistical data. Combining both can provide a more comprehensive analytical perspective.</li></ul></p>`} id={100386} />
