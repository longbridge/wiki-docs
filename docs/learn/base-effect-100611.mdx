The base effect is the effect that choosing a different reference point for a comparison between two data points can have on the result of the comparison. This often involves the use of some kind of ratio or index value between two points in a time-series data set, but can also apply to cross-sectional or other types of data.Thinking about the base effect in comparing different numbers or pieces of data means considering the question, "Compared to what?" The choice of the basis for comparison can have a large effect on the apparent result of a comparison. If ignored or misunderstood, the base effect can lead to a major distortion and possibly mistaken conclusions; however, if considered carefully, it can be leveraged to improve an analyst's understanding of the data and the underlying processes that generate them.
