In the early futures market, traders found that certain contracts had much higher trading volumes and liquidity than other contracts, and the price fluctuations of these contracts also had a more significant impact on the market. Therefore, traders began to refer to these contracts as the “main contracts.”</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The main contracts are usually divided into the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Commodity Futures Main Contracts:</strong> Such as futures contracts for crude oil, gold, copper, and other bulk commodities. These contracts usually have high trading volumes and liquidity, and their price fluctuations have a significant impact on the related commodity markets.</li><li><strong>Financial Futures Main Contracts:</strong> Such as futures contracts for stock indices, treasury bonds, and other financial products.

For example, in March 2020, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of the main S&P 500 index futures contract plummeted, reflecting market panic.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why do the price fluctuations of the main contract have a significant impact on the market?</strong> The high liquidity and large trading volume of the main contract allow its price fluctuations to quickly reflect market sentiment and expectations, thus having a significant impact on the market.</li><li><strong>How to identify the main contract?</strong> Usually, exchanges will publish data on the trading volume and open interest of each contract.
