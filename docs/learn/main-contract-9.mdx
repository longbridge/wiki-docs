<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The main contract refers to the contract with the largest trading volume and highest liquidity in a futures exchange. Due to its active trading characteristics, the price fluctuations of the main contract have a significant impact on the market and are often regarded as a barometer of the futures market.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of the main contract gradually formed with the development of the futures market. The futures market originated in the 17th century Japanese rice market, while the modern futures market developed in the 19th century in Chicago, USA. As the market matured, traders tended to choose contracts with active trading and good liquidity, which became the main contracts.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Main contracts are typically classified based on their trading volume and liquidity. Their features include high liquidity, low bid-ask spreads, and high market attention. The high liquidity of main contracts allows traders to enter and exit the market more easily, while low bid-ask spreads reduce trading costs. Additionally, the price fluctuations of main contracts are often used as indicators of market trends.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>A typical example is the U.S. crude oil futures market. The WTI crude oil futures contract is usually the main contract in this market because it has the largest trading volume and highest liquidity. Its price fluctuations often affect global crude oil market prices. Another example is China's rebar futures contract, which has the largest trading volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and serves as a price indicator for the steel market.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often encounter issues such as increased risk due to high market volatility and the risk of price manipulation due to high market attention when trading main contracts. Investors should be cautious in risk management and stay alert to market dynamics.</p>`} id={9} />
