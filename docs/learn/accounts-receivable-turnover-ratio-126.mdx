Accounts receivable turnover ratio is an indicator that measures the speed of a company's collection of accounts receivable. It reflects the ability of a company to convert accounts receivable into cash within a certain period of time. The higher the accounts receivable turnover ratio, the faster the company is able to collect its accounts receivable.
