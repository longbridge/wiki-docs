Decentralized applications, or dApps, are software programs that run on a blockchain orÂ peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of on a single computer. DApps (also called "dapps") are thus outside the purview and control of a single authority.DApps are often built on the Ethereum platform. They have been developed for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media.
