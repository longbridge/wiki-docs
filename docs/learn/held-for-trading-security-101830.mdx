A held-for-trading security is a debt or equity investment that investors purchase with the intent of selling within a short period of time, usually less than one year. Within that time frame, the investor hopes to see appreciation in the value of the security and sell it for a profit.Because of accounting standards, companies have to classify investments in debt or equity securities when they are purchased. Other than held-for trading, other options include held-to maturity or available for sale.
