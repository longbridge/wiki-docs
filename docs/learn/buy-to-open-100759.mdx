"Buy to open" is a term used by brokerages to represent the establishment of a new (opening) long call or put position in options. If a new options investor wants to buy a call or put, that investor should buy to open. A buy-to-open order indicates to market participants that the trader is establishing a new position rather than closing out an existing position. The sell to close order is used to exit a position taken with a buy-to-open order.Establishing a new short position is called sell to open, which would be closed out with a buy-to-close order. If a new options investor wants to sell a call or a put, that investor should sell to open.
