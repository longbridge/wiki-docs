A ledger balance is computed by a bank at the end of each business day and includes all withdrawals and deposits to calculate the total amount of money in a bank account. The ledger balance is the opening balance in the bank account the next morning and remains the same all day.The ledger balance is also often referred to as the current balance and is different than the available balance in an account. If you log into your online banking, you may see your current balance—the balance at the beginning of the day—and the available balance, which is the aggregate amount at any point during the day.In banking and accounting, the ledger balance is used in the reconciliation of book balances.
