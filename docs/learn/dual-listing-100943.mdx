A dual listing refers to a listing of any security on two or more different exchanges. Companies use dual listings because of their benefits, which include additional liquidity, increased access to capital, and the ability for their shares to trade for longer periods if the exchanges on which their shares are listed are in different time zones.Some exchanges have a number of listing categories for companies that seek a dual listing, each with different requirements and benefits.
