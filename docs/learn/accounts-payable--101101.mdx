<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Accounts payable refers to the amounts a company owes to its suppliers for goods or services purchased but not yet paid for. Accounts payable is a common short-term liability in a company's operations.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of accounts payable originated in the early stages of commercial transactions when businesses conducted transactions on credit.

Flexibility: companies can negotiate to extend payment terms.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A manufacturing company purchases raw materials worth 1 million yuan from a supplier, with an agreement to pay within 60 days. This amount is recorded as accounts payable until it is paid. Case 2: A retail company leases a warehouse with a monthly rent of 50,000 yuan, payable at the end of each month. This rent is recorded as accounts payable until it is paid.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What is the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable? Accounts payable are amounts a company needs to pay, while accounts receivable are amounts a company is owed. 2. Do accounts payable incur interest?
