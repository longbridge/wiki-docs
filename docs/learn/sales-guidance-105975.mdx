Sales guidance is a projection of a company's future sales revenue, typically for the coming quarter or fiscal year. It is provided by company management to investors and analysts as an estimate of what they believe the company will achieve in terms of sales volume. Sales guidance can be impacted by a variety of factors, including market conditions, competition, and changes in consumer behavior.
