An indifference curve is a chart showing various combinations of two goods or commodities that consumers can choose. At any point on the curve, the combination of the two will leave the consumer equally well off or equally satisfied—hence indifferent.For instance, if you like both hot dogs and hamburgers, you may be indifferent to buying either 20 hot dogs and no hamburgers, 45 hamburgers and no hot dogs, or some combination of the two—for example, 14 hot dogs and 20 hamburgers (see point “A” in the chart below). Either combination provides the same utility.
