Fixed income broadly refers to those types of investment security that pay investors fixed interest or dividend payments until their maturity date. At maturity, investors are repaid the principal amount they had invested. Government and corporate bonds are the most common types of fixed-income products.Unlike equities that may pay out no cash flows to investors, or variable-income securities, where payments can change based on some underlying measure—such as short-term interest rates—the payments of a fixed-income security are known in advance and remain fixed throughout.In addition to purchasing fixed-income securities directly, there are several fixed-income exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds available to investors.
