M2 refers to the total amount of monetary assets within a certain period, also known as broad money supply.It is an estimate of the overall money supply within the financial system, typically including cash held by individuals, as well as deposit accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term savings instruments (such as certificates of deposit).
In money supply, M0 and M1 are also included. 
M0 = cash in circulation; 
M1 = M0 + demand deposits in commercial banks, also known as narrow money supply. 
M2 = M1 + time deposits in commercial banks.
