A bear hug is an offer to buy a publicly listed company at a significant premium to the market price of its shares. It is an acquisition strategy designed to appeal to the target company's shareholders. Bear hugs are used to pressure a reluctant company's board to accept the bid or risk upsetting its shareholders. Unsolicited in nature, a bear hug bidder makes it difficult for the target's board to refuse by offering a price well above the pursued company's market value.
