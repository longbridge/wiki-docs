The term unrealized gain refers to an increase in the value of an asset, such as a stock position or a commodity like gold, that has yet to be sold for cash. As such, an unrealized gain is one that takes place on paper, as it has yet to be realized. An unrealized gain becomes realized once the position is sold for a profit. It is possible for an unrealized gain to be erased if the asset's value drops below the price at which it was bought.
