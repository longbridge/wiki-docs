AAA is the highest possible rating that may be assigned to an issuer’s bonds by any of the major credit-rating agencies. AAA-rated bonds have a high degree of creditworthiness because their issuers are easily able to meet financial commitments and have the lowest risk of default.Rating agencies Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch Ratings use the letters AAA to identify bonds with the highest credit quality, while Moody’s uses a slightly different Aaa to signify a bond’s top-tier credit rating.
