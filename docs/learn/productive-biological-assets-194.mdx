Productive biological assets refer to biological resources used in the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. It includes crops, fruit trees, timber, fish, and shrimp, etc. Productive biological assets have the ability to grow and reproduce, and can generate economic benefits during use. In financial statements, productive biological assets are measured according to the cost impairment model.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Productive Biological Assets</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Productive biological assets refer to biological resources used in production fields such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries. These include crops, fruit trees, timber, fish, and shrimp. Productive biological assets have the ability to grow and reproduce, generating economic benefits during their use. In financial statements, productive biological assets are measured using the cost impairment model.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of productive biological assets has gradually formed with the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. As early as ancient times, people began to use plant and animal resources for production activities. With the development of modern agricultural technology, the management and measurement methods of productive biological assets have also become standardized.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Productive biological assets can be divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Crops:</strong> Such as wheat and corn, characterized by cyclical growth and harvest.</li><li><strong>Fruit Trees:</strong> Such as apple trees and orange trees, characterized by long-term growth and continuous fruit production.</li><li><strong>Timber:</strong> Such as pine and oak trees, characterized by long-term growth and timber production.</li><li><strong>Aquatic Products:</strong> Such as fish and shrimp, characterized by rapid growth and high efficiency.</li></ul><p>These assets can generate economic benefits during their use and have the ability to grow and reproduce.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case One:</strong> A farm planted 1,000 apple trees, which can harvest a large number of apples each year for sale. The apple trees require certain management costs during their growth, but the annual economic benefits far exceed the costs.</p><p><strong>Case Two:</strong> A fishery farmed a large number of fish and shrimp. Through scientific management and feeding, it can harvest a large number of aquatic products each year for sale, generating considerable economic benefits.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question One:</strong> How are productive biological assets measured in financial statements?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Productive biological assets are measured using the cost impairment model, which is the initial cost minus accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.</p><p><strong>Question Two:</strong> How can the management costs of productive biological assets be controlled?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Through scientific management and technical means, the management costs of productive biological assets can be effectively controlled, improving economic benefits.</p>`} id={194} />
