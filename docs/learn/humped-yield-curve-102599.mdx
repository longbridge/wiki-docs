A humped yield curve is a relatively rare type of yield curve that results when the interest rates on medium-term fixed income securities are higher than the rates of both long and short-term instruments. Also, if short-term interest rates are expected to rise and then fall, then a humped yield curve will ensue. Humped yield curves are also known as bell-shaped curves.
