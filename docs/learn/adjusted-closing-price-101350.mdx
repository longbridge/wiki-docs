<p>The Adjusted Closing Price is the stock's closing price modified to account for corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, and rights offerings that occur after the trading day. This adjustment provides a more accurate reflection of a stock's historical performance and trends by incorporating the effects of these events. Essentially, the Adjusted Closing Price includes not just the market price on a given day but also all events that impact shareholder equity, making stock prices comparable across different periods.</p>
