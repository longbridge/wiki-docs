The term uptick volume refers to the volume of shares traded while a stock price rises. It is one of many indicators used by investors to make buy and sell decisions.Uptick volume is commonly used by traders who engage in technical analysis—the theory of using charts to see movements and patterns in stock prices and volumes over time. It is used to determine a stock's net volume—the measurement of its momentum—by subtracting the uptick volume from the downtick volume.
