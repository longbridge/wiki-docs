Covariance measures the directional relationship between the returns on two assets. A positive covariance means asset returns move together, while a negative covariance means they move inversely.Covariance is calculated by analyzing at-return surprises (standard deviations from the expected return) or multiplying the correlation between the two random variables by the standard deviation of each variable.
