Fully diluted shares are the total number of common shares of a company that will be outstanding and available to trade on the open market after all possible sources of conversion, such as convertible bonds and employee stock options, are exercised. Fully diluted shares include not only those which are currently issued but also those that could be claimed through conversion. This number of shares is needed for a companyâ€™s earnings per share (EPS) calculations because applying fully diluted shares increases the share basis in the calculation while reducing the dollars earned per share of common stock.

Fully diluted shares include not only the currently issued shares but also those that can be obtained through conversion. This number is crucial for calculating the company's earnings per share (EPS), as using fully diluted shares increases the share base in the calculation, thereby reducing the earnings per share for common stock.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of fully diluted shares originated from the need for accurate financial reporting, particularly in calculating earnings per share (EPS). With the diversification of financial instruments such as convertible bonds, stock options, and warrants, traditional EPS calculation methods could no longer accurately reflect a company's profitability.
