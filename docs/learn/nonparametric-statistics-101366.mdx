Nonparametric statisticsÂ refers to a statistical method in which the data are not assumed to come from prescribed models that are determined by a small number of parameters; examples of such models include the normal distribution model and the linear regression model. Nonparametric statistics sometimes uses data that is ordinal, meaning it does not rely on numbers, but rather on a ranking or order of sorts. For example, a survey conveying consumer preferences ranging from like to dislike would be considered ordinal data.Nonparametric statistics includes nonparametric descriptive statistics, statistical models, inference, and statistical tests. The model structure of nonparametric models is not specified  but is instead determined from data. The term  is not meant to imply that such models completely lack parameters, but rather that the number and nature of the parameters are flexible and not fixed in advance. A histogram is an example of a nonparametric estimate of a probability distribution.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-parametric statistics is a statistical method that does not assume data comes from a predetermined model defined by a small number of parameters; these models include normal distribution models and linear regression models. Non-parametric statistics sometimes use ordinal data, which means it relies on ranking or ordering rather than numerical values. For example, a survey expressing consumer preferences ranging from like to dislike is considered ordinal data. Non-parametric statistics include non-parametric descriptive statistics, statistical models, inference, and statistical tests. The structure of non-parametric models is not specified but is determined based on the data. The term does not mean that these models completely lack parameters, but the number and nature of the parameters are flexible and not fixed in advance. A histogram is an example of a non-parametric probability distribution.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-parametric statistics originated in the early 20th century. As statistics developed, researchers found that traditional parametric statistical methods had limitations when dealing with certain types of data. Non-parametric statistical methods showed unique advantages, especially when dealing with non-normal distributions or small sample data. In the mid-20th century, with the advancement of computing technology, non-parametric statistical methods gained wider application and development.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-parametric statistical methods can be divided into the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Non-parametric descriptive statistics:</strong> Such as median, quartiles, etc., used to describe the central tendency and dispersion of data.</li><li><strong>Non-parametric statistical models:</strong> Such as kernel density estimation, used to estimate the probability distribution of data.</li><li><strong>Non-parametric inference:</strong> Such as rank-sum test, sign test, etc., used for hypothesis testing.</li><li><strong>Non-parametric statistical tests:</strong> Such as chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, etc., used to compare the distributions of multiple samples.</li></ul>The main characteristics of non-parametric statistics include:<ul><li>Does not rely on distribution assumptions of the data, suitable for various types of data.</li><li>High flexibility, capable of handling ordinal and categorical data.</li><li>Performs well in small sample situations.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> In market research, researchers want to understand consumer preferences for a product. Since preference data is ordinal (e.g., like very much, like, neutral, dislike, dislike very much), researchers used the rank-sum test in non-parametric statistics to analyze the data and concluded significant consumer preferences.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> In medical research, researchers want to compare the effects of two treatments. Since the sample size is small and the data does not follow a normal distribution, researchers chose the Mann-Whitney U test in non-parametric statistics, and the results showed a significant difference in the effects of the two treatments.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Do non-parametric statistical methods completely avoid using parameters?</strong> Non-parametric statistical methods do not completely avoid using parameters; rather, the number and nature of the parameters are flexible and not fixed in advance.</li><li><strong>Are non-parametric statistical methods suitable for all types of data?</strong> Although non-parametric statistical methods are highly flexible, in some cases, parametric statistical methods may be more effective, especially when the data meets certain distribution assumptions.</li></ul></p>`} id={101366} />
