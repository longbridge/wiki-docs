<p>The Average Daily Balance Method (ADB Method) is a way of calculating interest on credit card balances and bank accounts. This method determines the interest payable or receivable by calculating the average daily balance of the account over the interest period. The ADB Method is commonly used by credit card companies to compute interest charges and by banks to calculate interest on savings or loan accounts.</p><p>Key characteristics include:</p><ol><li><strong>Daily Calculation</strong>: Records the account balance daily and sums up the balances for all days in the period.</li><li><strong>Average Calculation</strong>: Divides the sum of daily balances by the number of days in the interest period to obtain the average daily balance.</li><li><strong>Interest Calculation</strong>: Uses the average daily balance and the applicable interest rate to calculate the interest payable or receivable.</li></ol><p>Steps to calculate using the Average Daily Balance Method:</p><ol><li><strong>Record Daily Balances</strong>: Record the account balance for each day in the interest period.</li><li><strong>Sum Balances</strong>: Add up the daily balances for the entire interest period.</li><li><strong>Calculate Average Daily Balance</strong>: Divide the total balance by the number of days in the interest period to get the average daily balance.</li><li><strong>Compute Interest</strong>: Multiply the average daily balance by the daily interest rate and then by the number of days in the period to find the interest amount.</li></ol><p>Example application: Suppose a credit card account has the following daily balances over a 30-day billing cycle:</p><ul><li>Days 1-10: $1000</li><li>Days 11-20: $1500</li><li>Days 21-30: $1200</li></ul><p>The calculation is as follows:</p><p><strong>Record Daily Balances</strong>:</p><ul><li>First 10 days: $1000 × 10 = $10000</li><li>Next 10 days: $1500 × 10 = $15000</li><li>Last 10 days: $1200 × 10 = $12000</li></ul><p><strong>Sum Balances</strong>: $10000 + $15000 + $12000 = $37000</p><p><strong>Calculate Average Daily Balance</strong>: $37000 ÷ 30 days = $1233.33</p><p><strong>Compute Interest</strong> (assuming an annual interest rate of 18% and a daily rate of 18% ÷ 365):</p><ul><li>Daily rate = 0.18 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.000493</li><li>Interest = $1233.33 × 0.000493 × 30 days ≈ $18.20</li></ul>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>The Average Daily Balance Method (ADB Method) is a way to calculate interest on credit cards and bank accounts. This method determines the payable or receivable interest by calculating the average value of the daily account balance during the interest period. The ADB Method is commonly used by credit card companies to calculate interest owed and by banks to calculate interest on savings or loan accounts.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong></p><p>The origin of the Average Daily Balance Method can be traced back to the mid-20th century when banks and financial institutions began seeking fairer and more accurate methods to calculate interest. With the widespread use of credit cards, this method gradually became the standard because it more accurately reflects the actual usage of the account holder.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Daily Calculation:</strong> Record the account balance every day and sum the balances for all days.</li><li><strong>Average Value:</strong> Divide the total balance of all days in the interest period by the number of days to get the average daily balance.</li><li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> Calculate the payable or receivable interest based on the average daily balance and the corresponding interest rate.</li></ol><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong></p><p>Assume a credit card account has the following daily balances during an interest period:</p><ul><li>Days 1-10: $1000</li><li>Days 11-20: $1500</li><li>Days 21-30: $2000</li></ul><p>The calculation method is as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Record Daily Balances:</strong> First 10 days: $1000 × 10 = $10000; Middle 10 days: $1500 × 10 = $15000; Last 10 days: $2000 × 10 = $20000.</li><li><strong>Calculate Total Balance:</strong> $10000 + $15000 + $20000 = $45000.</li><li><strong>Calculate Average Daily Balance:</strong> $45000 ÷ 30 days = $1500.</li><li><strong>Calculate Interest:</strong> Assuming an annual interest rate of 18%, the daily interest rate is 18% ÷ 365 ≈ 0.000493.
