<p>An immediate or cancel order (IOC) is an order to buy or sell a security that will execute all or part immediately and then cancel any unfilled portion of the order. An IOC order is one of several "duration," or time-in-force orders, that investors can use to specify how long the order remains active in the market and under what conditions the order is canceled.</p><p>Other commonly used duration order types include fill or kill(FOK), all or none (AON), and good â€˜till canceled (GTC). Most online trading platforms allow IOC orders to be placed manually or programmed into automated trading strategies.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An Immediate or Cancel (IOC) order is a type of securities order that will execute all or part of the transaction immediately and cancel any unfilled portion. IOC orders are one of several 'duration' or time-in-force orders that investors can use to specify how long an order remains active in the market and under what conditions it should be canceled.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of IOC orders originated from traditional stock exchanges. With the development of electronic trading platforms, this type of order has become more widespread. It was designed to enhance trading efficiency and reduce the impact of market volatility on order execution.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> IOC orders are a type of 'duration' order. Other common duration orders include Fill or Kill (FOK), All or None (AON), and Good Till Canceled (GTC). The main characteristics of IOC orders are their flexibility in partial fills and the mechanism to quickly cancel the unfilled portion, making them popular in high-frequency trading and automated trading strategies.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose Investor A wants to buy 1,000 shares of a company at $50 per share, but there is insufficient market liquidity, with only 600 shares available. Using an IOC order, Investor A's order will immediately fill 600 shares, and the remaining 400 shares will be automatically canceled. Case 2: Investor B wants to sell 500 shares of a company at $30 per share, but no buyers are willing to purchase at that price. Using an IOC order, Investor B's order will be immediately canceled since there is no partial or full fill.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why use IOC orders? Answer: IOC orders are suitable for investors who want to quickly execute part of a trade and avoid the unfilled portion affecting the market price. 2. What is the difference between IOC and FOK orders? Answer: IOC orders allow partial fills, whereas FOK orders require the entire order to be filled or it will be canceled.</p>`} id={102664} />
