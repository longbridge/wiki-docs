An immediate or cancel order (IOC) is an order to buy or sell a security that attempts to execute all or part immediately and then cancels any unfilled portion of the order. An IOC order is one of several "duration," or time in force orders, that investors can use to specify how long the order remains active in the market and under what conditions the order is canceled.Other commonly used duration order types include fill or kill (FOK), all or none (AON) and good â€˜till canceled (GTC). Most online trading platforms allow IOC orders to be placed manually or programmed into automated trading strategies.
