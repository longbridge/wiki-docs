An underfunded pension plan is aÂ company-sponsored retirement plan that has more liabilities than assets. In other words, the money needed to cover current and future retirements is not readily available. This means there is no assurance that future retirees will receive the pensions they were promised or that current retirees will continue to get their previously established distribution amount. An underfunded pension may be contrasted with a fully-funded or overfunded pension.
