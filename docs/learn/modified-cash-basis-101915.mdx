Modified cash basis is an accounting method that combines elements of the two primary bookkeeping practices: cash and accrual accounting. It seeks to get the best of both worlds, recording sales and expenses for long-term assets on an accrual basis and those of short-term assets on a cash basis. The goal here is to provide a clearer financial picture without dealing with the costs of switching to full-blown accrual accounting.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Modified Cash Basis</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The modified cash basis is an accounting method that combines elements of both cash accounting and accrual accounting. It aims to use accrual basis for recording the sales and expenses of long-term assets, while using cash basis for short-term assets.

This allows the company to more accurately reflect the value of its long-term assets while simplifying daily financial records.</p><p>Case 2: A service company adopts the modified cash basis accounting method. The company records the purchase and depreciation of long-term assets like office buildings and equipment using the accrual basis, while using the cash basis for service revenue and daily operating expenses.
