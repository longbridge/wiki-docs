Rolling returns, also known as "rolling period returns" or "rolling time periods," are annualized average returns for a period, ending with the listed year. Rolling returns are useful for examining the behavior of returns for holding periods, similar to those actually experienced by investors.Looking at a portfolio or fund’s rolling returns will give performance results that are smoothed over several periods throughout its history. Such information often paints a more accurate picture for an investor than a single snapshot of one period.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Rolling Return</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Rolling return, also known as “rolling period return” or “rolling time period return,” refers to the annualized average return over a specified period ending in the listed year. It smooths performance results over multiple periods, providing a more accurate picture of investment performance than a single-period snapshot.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of rolling return originated from in-depth studies of investment performance, aiming to better understand and evaluate the performance of portfolios or funds over different time periods. As financial markets became more complex, investors needed a more comprehensive method to assess long-term returns, leading to the application of rolling returns.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Rolling returns can be categorized by different time periods, such as 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, or 10-year rolling returns. Each time period has its unique characteristics and application scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>Short-term rolling return (1 year):</strong> Useful for assessing the volatility and performance of a portfolio in the short term.</li><li><strong>Mid-term rolling return (3-5 years):</strong> Helps understand the stability and growth potential of a portfolio in the mid-term.</li><li><strong>Long-term rolling return (10 years and above):</strong> Used to evaluate the long-term performance and strategic effectiveness of a portfolio.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose an investor invests in a fund every year from 2010 to 2020. By calculating the rolling return for each year, the investor can see the fund's performance in different years. For example, the 5-year rolling return from 2010-2015 and the 5-year rolling return from 2015-2020 may differ, reflecting changes in market conditions and fund management strategies.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A portfolio's 10-year rolling return from 2000 to 2020 shows a significant decline during the 2008 financial crisis but gradually recovers in the following years. This rolling return analysis helps investors understand the volatility and recovery capability of long-term investments.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is rolling return more useful than a single-period return?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Rolling return provides a more comprehensive and accurate picture of investment performance by smoothing results over multiple periods, avoiding potential misleading data from a single period.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to choose the appropriate rolling return period?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The choice of period depends on investment goals and risk tolerance. Short-term rolling returns are suitable for assessing short-term volatility, while long-term rolling returns are better for evaluating the effectiveness of long-term investment strategies.</p>`} id={100540} />
