<p>Cash received from equity investments refers to funds that a company obtains from investors through the issuance of stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. These funds can be used for various purposes, such as operations, expansion, and research and development.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Cash received from investment absorption reflects the actual amount of funds a company receives through issuing stocks, bonds, and other means of raising capital. It represents the cash inflow from external financing activities, typically used to support the company's expansion and development.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of cash received from investment absorption has evolved with the increasing complexity of modern corporate financing activities. As capital markets have developed, companies frequently engage in activities like issuing stocks and bonds to raise funds, making this concept increasingly significant.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Cash received from investment absorption is mainly categorized into equity financing and debt financing. Equity financing includes issuing common and preferred stocks, characterized by no obligation to repay the principal but may dilute existing shareholders' equity. Debt financing involves issuing corporate bonds, characterized by the need to pay interest regularly and repay the principal, without affecting shareholders' equity.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: Alibaba raised approximately $25 billion through its initial public offering (IPO) in 2014, recorded as cash received from investment absorption, which helped the company expand its global operations. Case 2: Tesla raised $5 billion in 2020 by issuing bonds, which was used to support the development and production of its new models.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand cash received from investment absorption as equivalent to company profits. In reality, it is merely a method of raising funds and does not indicate the company's profitability. Additionally, excessive reliance on external financing can increase a company's financial risk.</p>`} id={71} />
