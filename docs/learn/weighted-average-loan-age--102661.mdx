The weighted average loan age (WALA) measures the average age of the loans in a pool of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The weights are based on the dollar amount of each loan at each maturity in proportion to the aggregate total of the pool and can be weighted on the remaining principal balance dollar figure or the nominal value of the loan.
