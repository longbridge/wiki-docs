The term "early adopter" refers to an individual or business who uses a new product, innovation, or technology before others. An early adopter is likely to pay more for the product than later adoptersÂ but accepts this premium if using the product improves efficiency, reduces cost, increases market penetration, or raises the early adopter's social status.Companies rely on early adopters to provide feedback about product deficiencies and to cover the cost of the product's research and development.
