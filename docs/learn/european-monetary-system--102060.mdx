The European Monetary System (EMS) was an adjustable exchange rate arrangement set up in 1979 to foster closer monetary policy cooperation between members of the European Community (EC). The European Monetary System (EMS) was later succeeded by the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which established a common currency, the euro.
