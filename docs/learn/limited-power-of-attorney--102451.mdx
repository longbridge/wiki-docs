Limited Power of Attorney (LPOA) is an authorization that permits a portfolio manager to perform specific functions on behalf of the account owner. In general, the LPOA allows the manager to execute an agreed-upon investment strategy and take care of routine related business without contacting the account holder.Before signing an LPOA, the client should be aware of the specific functions they have delegated to the portfolio manager, as the client remainsÂ liable for the decisions.
