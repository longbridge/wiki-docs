Quarterly revenue growth is an increase in a company's sales in one quarter compared to sales of a different quarter.The current quarter's sales figure can be compared on a year-over-year basis (e.g., 3Q sales of Year 1 compared with 3Q sales of Year 2) or sequentially (3Q sales of Year 1 compared with 4Q sales of Year 1). This gives analysts, investors, and additional stakeholders an idea of how much a company's sales are increasing over time.
