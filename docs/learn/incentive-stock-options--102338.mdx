An incentive stock option (ISO) is a corporate benefit that gives an employee the right to buy shares of company stock at a discounted price with the added benefit of possible tax breaks on the profit. The profit on qualified ISOs is usually taxed at the capital gains rate, not the higher rate for ordinary income. Non-qualified stock options (NSOs) are taxed as ordinary income.Generally, ISO stock is awarded only to top management and highly-valued employees. ISOs also are called statutory or qualified stock options.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) are a type of employee benefit that allows employees to purchase company stock at a discounted price and potentially enjoy tax advantages on the profits. Qualified ISO profits are typically taxed at the capital gains tax rate, which is lower than the ordinary income tax rate. Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs) are taxed as ordinary income. ISOs are usually granted to senior executives and high-value employees. ISOs are also known as statutory stock options or qualified stock options.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Incentive Stock Options originated in the mid-20th century, aimed at incentivizing employees to hold company stock through tax advantages, thereby enhancing their sense of belonging and work motivation. In 1976, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Reform Act, which formally established the legal status of ISOs.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Incentive Stock Options are mainly divided into two categories: ISOs and NSOs. ISOs are characterized by tax advantages, with profits taxed at the capital gains tax rate, but they have strict grant and exercise conditions. NSOs do not have tax advantages, with profits taxed as ordinary income, but they have relatively relaxed grant and exercise conditions. ISOs are typically granted to senior executives and high-value employees, while NSOs can be granted to any employee.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A tech company grants its senior engineer, Zhang San, 1,000 ISOs with an exercise price of $10 per share. Two years later, Zhang San exercises the options when the market price is $20 per share. Zhang San buys 1,000 shares at $10 each and sells them a year later at $30 per share. Zhang San's profit is (30-10)*1000=$20,000, taxed at the capital gains tax rate. Case 2: A retail company grants its sales manager, Li Si, 500 NSOs with an exercise price of $5 per share. A year later, Li Si exercises the options when the market price is $15 per share. Li Si buys 500 shares at $5 each and sells them six months later at $20 per share. Li Si's profit is (20-5)*500=$7,500, taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Q: What is the main difference between ISOs and NSOs? A: ISOs have tax advantages, with profits taxed at the capital gains tax rate, but have strict grant and exercise conditions; NSOs do not have tax advantages, with profits taxed as ordinary income, but have relatively relaxed grant and exercise conditions. 2. Q: What are the conditions for ISO tax advantages? A: ISOs must be sold at least two years after the grant date and at least one year after the exercise date to qualify for the capital gains tax rate.</p>`} id={102338} />
