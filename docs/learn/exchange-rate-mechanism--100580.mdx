An exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is a set of procedures used to manage a country'sÂ currency exchange rate relative to other currencies. It is part of an economy's monetary policy and is put to use by central banks.Such a mechanism can be employed if a country utilizes either a fixed exchange rate or one with a constrained floating exchange rate that is bounded around its peg (known as an adjustable peg or crawling peg).
