<p>Window Dressing refers to the practice of making financial statements appear more attractive than they really are, typically conducted by companies at the end of a reporting period. This is often done at the end of a quarter or fiscal year to attract investors or meet certain financial benchmarks. Common window dressing techniques include temporarily reducing liabilities, inflating revenues, or adjusting items on the balance sheet. While this practice can improve the company's appearance in the short term, it may harm the company's reputation and shareholder interests in the long run.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Window dressing refers to the actions taken by a company before the end of a financial reporting period to make its financial situation appear better than it actually is. This behavior is usually carried out at the end of a quarter or year, aiming to attract investors or meet certain financial metrics.
