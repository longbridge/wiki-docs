A currency peg is a policy in which a national government or central bank sets a fixed exchange rate for its currency with a foreign currency or a basket of currencies and stabilizes the exchange rate between countries.The currency exchange rate is the value of a currency compared to another. While some currencies are free-floating and rates fluctuate based on supply and demand in the market, others are fixed and pegged to another currency.Pegging provides long-term predictability of exchange rates for business planning and helps to promote economic stability.
