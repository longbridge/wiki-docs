A required minimum distribution (RMD) is the amount of money that must be withdrawn annually from an employer-sponsored retirement plan, traditional IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE individual retirement account (IRA) by owners and qualified retirement plan participants of retirement age.In 2022, Congress raised the age at which you must begin taking RMDs. In 2023, that is age 73. Account holders must therefore start withdrawing from a retirement account by April 1, following the year that they reach age 73. The account holder must then withdraw the properly-calculated RMD amount each subsequent year.Another significant change arising from Secure 2.0: Starting in 2024, holders of designated Roth 401(k) accounts will no longer be required to take RMDs. This rule is already true for Roth IRAs.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) refers to the minimum amount that must be withdrawn annually from employer-sponsored retirement plans, traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, or SIMPLE IRAs by the account owners and qualified retirement plan participants who have reached retirement age. The purpose of RMD is to ensure that funds in retirement accounts are gradually withdrawn and taxed after the account holder retires.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of RMD originated from U.S. tax law to prevent indefinite tax deferral on retirement account funds. The initial RMD regulations were introduced in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In 2022, Congress passed legislation raising the age to start taking RMDs to 73.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>RMD applies to various retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and employer-sponsored retirement plans (such as 401(k)). The calculation method for RMD is similar across these account types, but specific withdrawal rules and tax implications may vary. Roth IRA account holders are not required to take RMDs, and starting in 2024, Roth 401(k) account holders will also no longer need to take RMDs.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Mr. Li turns 73 in 2023 and has a traditional IRA account. According to RMD regulations, Mr. Li must start taking his RMD by April 1, 2024. Assuming his account balance is $100,000, and the life expectancy factor is 25, Mr. Li needs to withdraw $4,000.</p><p>Case 2: Ms. Wang turns 73 in 2024 and has a Roth 401(k) account. Under the new regulations, Ms. Wang is no longer required to take RMDs, allowing her to continue growing her account funds without mandatory withdrawals.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>Q1: What happens if I don't take my RMD on time?<br/>A1: If you fail to take your RMD on time, the amount not withdrawn will be subject to a 50% penalty.</p><p>Q2: How is the RMD amount calculated?<br/>A2: The RMD amount is calculated based on the account balance and the life expectancy factor, using the formula: RMD amount = Account Balance / Life Expectancy Factor.</p>`} id={101801} />
