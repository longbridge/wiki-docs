A managed account is an investment account that is owned by an investor but managed by somebody else. The account owner can either be an institutional investor or an individual retail investor. A professional money manager hired by the investor then oversees the account and the trading activity within it.Armed with discretionary authority over the account, the dedicated manager actively makes investment decisions pertinent to the individual, considering the client's needs and goals, risk tolerance, and asset size. Managed accounts are most often seen among high-net-worth investors.

The account owner can be an institutional investor or an individual retail investor. The investor hires a professional fund manager to oversee the account and its trading activities. With autonomy over the account, the dedicated manager actively makes investment decisions relevant to the individual, considering the client's needs and goals, risk tolerance, and asset size. Managed accounts are most common among high-net-worth investors.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of managed accounts originated in the mid-20th century as financial markets became more complex and specialized.

They choose a reputable investment firm to manage their investment account.
