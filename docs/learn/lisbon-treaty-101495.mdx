<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Lisbon Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Lisbon, is an amendment to the existing treaties of the European Union (EU) aimed at enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the EU. It updates EU regulations, establishes more centralized leadership and foreign policy, provides a proper process for countries wishing to leave the Union, and simplifies the process of making new policies.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Lisbon Treaty was signed on December 13, 2007, in Lisbon, Portugal, and came into force on December 1, 2009. It amended the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Rome, which are the foundational treaties of the EU.</p><p><strong>Categories and Features:</strong> The main features of the Lisbon Treaty include: 1. Enhanced powers for the European Parliament, giving it more say in the legislative process; 2. Creation of two new positions: the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to strengthen EU leadership and foreign policy; 3. Introduction of an exit clause, providing a clear legal procedure for countries wishing to leave the EU; 4. Simplification of the decision-making process, particularly by introducing majority voting in certain policy areas.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. Brexit: The exit clause (Article 50) of the Lisbon Treaty was first applied during the Brexit process. The UK decided to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum and formally triggered Article 50 in 2017, eventually leaving the EU on January 31, 2020. 2. EU Foreign Policy: The position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, established by the Lisbon Treaty, has given the EU a more unified voice in international affairs. For example, in the Iran nuclear issue, the EU coordinated member states' positions through this role, playing a significant diplomatic role.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How does the Lisbon Treaty affect the EU's decision-making process? Answer: The Lisbon Treaty simplifies the decision-making process, particularly by introducing majority voting in certain policy areas, reducing deadlock among member states. 2. What are the specifics of the exit clause? Answer: The exit clause (Article 50) outlines the procedure for a member state to voluntarily leave the EU, including notifying the European Council, negotiating an exit agreement, and completing the exit within two years.</p>`} id={101495} />
