A share class is a designation applied to a specified type of security such as common stock or mutual fund unit. Companies that have more than one class of common stock usually identify a given class with alphabetic markers, such as "Class A" shares and "Class B" shares; these carry different rights and privileges. Mutual funds also have share classes, which carry different sales charges, expense ratios, and minimum initial investment requirements.As an investor, it's important to know what class of shares you are buying, be it common stock in a public company or units of a mutual fund.
