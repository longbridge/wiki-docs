<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cash Flow from Investing (CFI) is a section of the cash flow statement that reports the amount of cash generated or spent on various investment-related activities during a specific period. Investing activities include the purchase of physical assets, investment in securities, or the sale of securities or assets. Negative cash flow often indicates poor company performance. However, negative cash flow from investing activities may result from significant cash being invested in the company's long-term health, such as R&D.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of cash flow from investing emerged with the standardization of modern financial statements. In the early 20th century, as companies grew larger and financial management became more complex, the cash flow statement gradually became an essential part of financial reporting. In 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 95, formally requiring companies to include a cash flow statement in their financial reports, thereby clarifying the definition and reporting requirements for cash flow from investing activities.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Cash flow from investing activities can be divided into three main categories: 1. Capital Expenditures (CapEx): Includes the purchase of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and equipment. 2. Investment in Securities: Includes the purchase or sale of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. 3. Other Investments: Includes equity investments in other companies or long-term loans. Each type of investing activity has its characteristics and application scenarios. For example, capital expenditures are typically used to expand production capacity, while investment in securities may be used for short-term financial management.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A tech company invested heavily in R&D for new products in 2023, resulting in negative cash flow from investing activities. However, this negative cash flow indicates potential high returns in the future. Case 2: A manufacturing company sold some idle production equipment, generating significant cash inflow, resulting in positive cash flow from investing activities. This cash inflow can be used to pay off debt or make new investments.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why is negative cash flow from investing activities not necessarily a bad thing? Answer: Negative cash flow may result from the company making long-term investments, such as R&D or purchasing new equipment, which can contribute to future growth. 2. How to distinguish between cash flow from investing activities and cash flow from operating activities? Answer: Cash flow from investing activities primarily involves the purchase and sale of long-term assets, while cash flow from operating activities involves the cash inflows and outflows from daily business operations.</p>`} id={102598} />
