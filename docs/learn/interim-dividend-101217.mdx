An interim dividend is a dividend payment made before a company's annual general meeting (AGM) and the release of final financial statements. This declared dividend usually accompanies the company's interim financial statements. The interim dividend is issued more frequently in the United Kingdom where dividends are often paid semi-annually. The interim dividend is typically the smaller of the two payments made to shareholders.
