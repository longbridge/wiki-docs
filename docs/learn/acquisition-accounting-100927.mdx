Acquisition accounting is a set of formal guidelines describing how assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest (NCI) and goodwill of a purchased company must be reported by the buyer on its consolidated statement of financial position.The fair market value(FMV) of the acquired company is allocated between the net tangibleand intangible assets portion of the balance sheet of the buyer. Any resulting difference is regarded as goodwill. Acquisition accounting is also referred to as business combination accounting.
