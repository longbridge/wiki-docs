The book-to-market ratio is one indicator of a company's value. The ratio compares a firm's book value to its market value. A company's book value is calculated by looking at the company's historical cost, or accounting value. A firm's market value is determined by its share price in the stock market and the number of shares it has outstanding, which is its market capitalization.
