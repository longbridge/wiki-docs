<p>Interest rate sensitivity is a measure of how much the price of a fixed-income asset will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Securities that are more sensitive have greater price fluctuations than those with less sensitivity.</p><p>This type of sensitivity must be taken into account when selecting a bond or other fixed-income instrument the investor may sell in the secondary market. Interest rate sensitivity affects buying as well as selling.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Interest Rate Sensitivity</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree to which the price of fixed-income assets fluctuates with changes in the interest rate environment. Securities with high sensitivity experience significant price fluctuations, while those with low sensitivity experience smaller price changes. Interest rate sensitivity is crucial when investors choose bonds or other fixed-income instruments that they might sell in the secondary market, as it directly impacts buy and sell decisions.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of interest rate sensitivity originated with the development of the fixed-income market. As the bond market matured, investors gradually recognized the impact of interest rate changes on bond prices. In the early 20th century, with the increasing complexity of financial markets and the diversification of financial instruments, interest rate sensitivity became a key factor in investment decisions.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Interest rate sensitivity can be categorized based on different fixed-income instruments:</p><ul><li><strong>Short-term Bonds:</strong> These bonds have a shorter maturity, typically within 1-3 years. Due to their shorter duration, they have lower sensitivity to interest rate changes.</li><li><strong>Long-term Bonds:</strong> These bonds have a longer maturity, typically over 10 years. Due to their longer duration, they have higher sensitivity to interest rate changes.</li><li><strong>Floating Rate Bonds:</strong> These bonds have interest rates that adjust according to market rates, so their prices have lower sensitivity to interest rate changes.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose Investor A holds a long-term bond with a maturity of 10 years. When market interest rates rise, the price of this bond will significantly decrease because newly issued bonds offer higher interest rates, making investors prefer new bonds over old ones.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Investor B holds a floating rate bond. When market interest rates rise, the interest rate on this bond will also increase accordingly, so its price will not fluctuate as much as a fixed-rate bond.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are long-term bonds more sensitive to interest rate changes?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Because the cash flows of long-term bonds are affected by interest rate changes over a longer period, an increase in interest rates will significantly reduce the present value of future cash flows.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I reduce the interest rate sensitivity of my investment portfolio?<br/><strong>A:</strong> You can reduce the interest rate sensitivity of your portfolio by increasing the proportion of short-term bonds or floating rate bonds.</p>`} id={101499} />
