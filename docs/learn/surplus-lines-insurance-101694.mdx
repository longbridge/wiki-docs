<AIContent content={`<h2>Excess Insurance</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Excess insurance is a type of insurance designed to protect against financial risks that are too large or too extraordinary for conventional insurance companies to handle. Both individuals and companies can purchase excess insurance.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of excess insurance originated in the mid-20th century when financial markets became increasingly complex, and traditional insurance products could not cover certain high-risk areas.

Each type has its unique characteristics and application scenarios. For example, natural disaster insurance is mainly used to address significant losses caused by earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters; political risk insurance protects companies' investments in politically unstable countries; special event insurance covers unique events such as terrorist attacks or the cancellation of large events.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A multinational company invested in building a factory in a politically unstable country. To mitigate potential property losses due to political turmoil, the company purchased political risk insurance. When a coup occurred in the country, the company's losses were compensated by the insurance company.</p><p>Case 2: The organizer of a large music festival purchased special event insurance to prevent economic losses due to event cancellation caused by weather conditions. Eventually, a sudden storm led to the event's cancellation, and the organizer received insurance compensation, reducing economic losses.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Is the premium for excess insurance very high?<br/>Answer: Since excess insurance covers high-risk areas, the premiums are usually higher, but the specific cost depends on the risk assessment results.</p><p>2. Do all insurance companies offer excess insurance?<br/>Answer: Not all insurance companies offer excess insurance. Typically, only large insurance companies or specialized insurance companies provide such products.</p>`} id={101694} />
