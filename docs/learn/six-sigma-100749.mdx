Six Sigma is a methodology for process improvement developed by a scientist at Motorola in the 1980s. Six Sigma practitioners use statistics, financial analysis, and project management to achieve improved business functionality and better quality control by identifying and then correcting mistakes or defects in existing processes. The five phases of the Six Sigma method, known as DMAIC, are defining, measuring, analyzing, improving, and controlling.
