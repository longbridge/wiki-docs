<p>General Equilibrium Theory is an economic theory aimed at explaining the state in which all markets in an economic system are simultaneously in equilibrium. In this state, the prices of goods and services adjust to balance supply and demand across all markets, resulting in no surplus or shortage. General Equilibrium Theory was introduced by French economist Léon Walras in the 19th century and further developed by other economists.</p><p>Key characteristics include:</p><p>Comprehensive Equilibrium: Considers the interactions of all markets rather than focusing on a single market.<br/>Price Mechanism: Prices adjust within markets to balance supply and demand.<br/>Resource Allocation: Achieves optimal allocation of resources across the entire economy through price signals.<br/>Mathematical Modeling: Uses mathematical models to describe and analyze equilibrium states in the economy.<br/>Example of General Equilibrium Theory application:<br/>Consider a simple economic system with two markets: Market A and Market B. Market A produces good X, and Market B produces good Y. According to General Equilibrium Theory, the prices of goods X and Y will adjust until the supply of good X in Market A equals the demand, and the supply of good Y in Market B equals the demand. At this point, the entire economic system reaches a general equilibrium state.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>General Equilibrium Theory is an economic theory that aims to explain the state in which all markets in an economic system simultaneously reach supply-demand equilibrium. In this state, the prices of goods and services adjust so that the supply and demand in all markets are perfectly balanced, with no surpluses or shortages. The theory was first proposed by French economist Léon Walras in the 19th century and was later developed further by other economists.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The origin of General Equilibrium Theory can be traced back to the 19th century when French economist Léon Walras first introduced it. He systematically elaborated on this theory in his 1874 publication, "Elements of Pure Economics." Walras' work laid the foundation for the use of mathematical models in modern economics to analyze economic phenomena. Later, economists like Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu further developed the theory, particularly in the mid-20th century, by mathematically proving the existence and uniqueness of general equilibrium under certain conditions.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Comprehensive Equilibrium:</strong> General Equilibrium Theory considers the interactions of all markets, not just individual ones.<br/>2. <strong>Price Mechanism:</strong> Prices adjust in the market to balance supply and demand.<br/>3. <strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Optimal allocation of resources across the economy is achieved through price signals.<br/>4. <strong>Mathematical Models:</strong> Uses mathematical models to describe and analyze equilibrium states in the economy.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case One:</strong> Suppose a simple economic system with only two markets: Market A and Market B. Market A produces good X, and Market B produces good Y. According to General Equilibrium Theory, the prices of goods X and Y will adjust until the supply of good X in Market A equals its demand, and the supply of good Y in Market B equals its demand. At this point, the entire economic system reaches a general equilibrium state.<br/>2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> In a more complex economic system, assume there are multiple markets and various goods. Each market's supply and demand are influenced by other markets. For example, Market C produces good Z, which is a raw material for producing goods X and Y in Markets A and B. According to General Equilibrium Theory, the prices of goods X, Y, and Z will adjust mutually until the supply and demand in all markets are balanced.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Does General Equilibrium Theory apply to the real world?</strong><br/>General Equilibrium Theory has limitations in the real world because it assumes all markets are perfectly competitive, information is fully symmetric, and there are no externalities. However, it remains an important tool for understanding how economic systems operate.<br/>2. <strong>How to handle market failures?</strong><br/>When market failures (such as monopolies, information asymmetry, externalities, etc.) occur, General Equilibrium Theory may not accurately describe economic phenomena. Other economic theories and policy tools are needed to address these issues.</p>`} id={102181} />
