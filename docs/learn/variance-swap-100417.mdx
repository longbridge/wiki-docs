A variance swap is a financial derivative used to hedge or speculate on the magnitude of a price movement of an underlying asset. These assets include exchange rates, interest rates, or the price of an index.Â In plain language, the variance is the difference between an expected result and the actual result.A variance swap is quite similar to a volatility swap, which utilizes realized volatility instead of variance.
