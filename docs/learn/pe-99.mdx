<p>The price-earnings ratio refers to the ratio between the market price of a stock and its earnings per share. The price-earnings ratio is one of the important indicators for evaluating stock investment, used to measure a company's profitability and investment value. A lower price-earnings ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a higher price-earnings ratio may indicate that the stock is overvalued. The price-earnings ratio can also be used to compare stock valuations between different companies or industries.</p>
