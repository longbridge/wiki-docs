A wraparound mortgage is a type of junior loan which wraps or includes, the current note due on the property. The wraparound loan will consist of the balance of the original loan plus an amount to cover the new purchase price for the property. These mortgages are a form of secondary financing. The seller of the property receives a secured promissory note, which is a legal IOU detailing the amount due. A wraparound mortgage is also known as a wrap loan, overriding mortgage, agreement for sale, or all-inclusive mortgage.
