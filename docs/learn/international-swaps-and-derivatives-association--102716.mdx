The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is a private trade organization whose members, mainly banks, transact in the OTC derivatives market. This association helps to improve the market for privately negotiated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives by identifying and reducing risks in that market.For nearly three decades, the industry has used the ISDA master agreement as a template for entering into a contractual obligation for derivatives, creating a basic structure and standardization where there were only bespoke transactions before.
