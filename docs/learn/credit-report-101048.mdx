A credit report is a detailed breakdown of your credit history prepared by a credit bureau. Credit bureaus collect financial information about you and compile their reports based on that information. Lenders use the reports, often along with other data, to determine your creditworthiness. Insurance companies, employers, and landlords may check your credit reports, as well.
