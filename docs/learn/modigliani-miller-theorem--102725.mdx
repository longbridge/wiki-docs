<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Modigliani-Miller Theorem (M&amp;M Theorem) states that in a perfect market, a company's market value should be correctly calculated as the present value of its future earnings and underlying assets, and it is independent of its capital structure. In other words, whether a company finances its growth through debt, issuing equity, or reinvesting profits does not affect its market value.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Modigliani-Miller Theorem was proposed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller in 1958. Their research had a significant impact on corporate finance theory in the 1950s and earned them the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Modigliani-Miller Theorem is primarily divided into two propositions:<br/>1. <strong>Proposition I:</strong> In the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, and asymmetric information, a company's capital structure does not affect its market value.<br/>2. <strong>Proposition II:</strong> When considering taxes, debt financing can provide a tax shield, thereby increasing the company's market value.<br/>These propositions are characterized by a set of strict assumptions, such as no market frictions, no taxes, and no bankruptcy costs.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case One:</strong> Suppose Company A and Company B are in the same industry, with identical assets and future earnings expectations. Company A is entirely equity-financed, while Company B is financed with 50% equity and 50% debt. According to M&amp;M Theorem Proposition I, in the absence of taxes and other market frictions, the market value of both companies should be the same.<br/>2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> Suppose Company C operates in a tax environment and increases its debt financing to utilize the tax shield. According to M&amp;M Theorem Proposition II, the market value of Company C will increase due to the presence of the tax shield.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Q:</strong> Why does a company's capital structure affect its market value in reality?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Because real markets have taxes, bankruptcy costs, asymmetric information, and other factors that influence a company's capital structure decisions and market value.<br/>2. <strong>Q:</strong> Do the assumptions of the Modigliani-Miller Theorem hold in reality?<br/><strong>A:</strong> In most cases, these assumptions do not fully hold in reality, but the theorem provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the impact of capital structure.</p>`} id={102725} />
