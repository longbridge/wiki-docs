An oversubscription privilege gets extended to a company’s shareholders on the issuance of a rights or warrants offering. The privilege allows shareholders to purchase any shares remaining after other shareholders have had an opportunity to purchase them.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Oversubscription Privilege is a special right offered to existing shareholders when a company issues equity securities or warrants. This privilege allows shareholders to purchase any remaining shares after other shareholders have had the opportunity to buy. This right typically appears during new stock issuance or additional stock offerings, aiming to protect the interests of existing shareholders.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the Oversubscription Privilege originated during the development of capital markets, particularly when companies needed to raise additional funds. In the early capital markets, shareholder protection mechanisms were relatively weak. The introduction of the Oversubscription Privilege provided shareholders with more participation opportunities, ensuring they were not diluted when the company expanded its capital structure.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Oversubscription Privilege mainly falls into two categories: 1. <em>Fixed Proportion Oversubscription Privilege</em>: Shareholders can purchase additional shares according to their existing holding proportion. 2. <em>Unrestricted Oversubscription Privilege</em>: Shareholders can purchase any number of remaining shares after other shareholders have subscribed. Characteristics include: <ul><li>Protecting existing shareholders' interests, preventing dilution of their holding proportion.</li><li>Providing additional investment opportunities, increasing potential returns for shareholders.</li><li>Potentially leading to competition among shareholders, especially when shares are in short supply.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><em>Case 1:</em> A company plans to issue 1 million new shares, and each existing shareholder has the right to subscribe to new shares according to their holding proportion. Shareholder A holds 10% of the company’s shares, thus has the right to subscribe to 100,000 shares. After other shareholders have subscribed, 200,000 shares remain unsubscribed. Shareholder A can exercise the Oversubscription Privilege to purchase a portion or all of these 200,000 shares.</li><li><em>Case 2:</em> Another company issues warrants, and each shareholder receives warrants according to their holding proportion. Shareholder B holds 5% of the company’s shares, thus receives 5% of the warrants. After other shareholders have exercised their warrants, some warrants remain unexercised. Shareholder B can exercise the Oversubscription Privilege to purchase these remaining warrants.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><em>Question:</em> Does the Oversubscription Privilege lead to competition among shareholders?<br/><em>Answer:</em> Yes, especially when shares are in short supply, shareholders may compete to purchase the remaining shares.</li><li><em>Question:</em> Does the Oversubscription Privilege affect the stock price?<br/><em>Answer:</em> It might, particularly when a large number of shares are subscribed, increasing market demand for the company’s stock, potentially leading to a rise in stock price.</li></ul></p>`} id={101587} />
