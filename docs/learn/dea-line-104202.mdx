As part of the MACD indicator, the DEA line has been widely used in technical analysis as the MACD gained popularity.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Categories:</strong> The DEA line does not have specific categories but is part of the MACD indicator, used in conjunction with the DIF line and the MACD histogram.<br/>2. <strong>Characteristics:</strong> The DEA line smooths out the fluctuations of the DIF line, helping investors to more clearly identify changes in price trends. Its main characteristic is its lagging nature, which effectively filters out short-term price fluctuations.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case One:</strong> In the daily K-line chart of a stock, the DIF line crosses above the DEA line, forming a “golden cross,” which is a buy signal indicating that the stock price may continue to rise.<br/>2. <strong>Case Two:</strong> In the daily K-line chart of another stock, the DIF line crosses below the DEA line, forming a “death cross,” which is a sell signal indicating that the stock price may continue to fall.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Lagging Nature of DEA Line:</strong> Since the DEA line is the 9-day average of the DIF line, it responds slowly to price changes and may miss some short-term trading opportunities.<br/>2. <strong>How to Set Parameters:</strong> Although the default 9-day average is commonly used, investors can adjust the parameters based on their trading style and market conditions.</p>`} id={104202} />
