<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Capital preservation is a conservative investment strategy with the primary goal of maintaining capital and preventing losses in the investment portfolio. It is typically suitable for investors with low risk tolerance, such as retirees or those nearing retirement.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of capital preservation dates back to the early 20th century when market uncertainty and volatility prompted investors to seek more stable investment methods.
