<p>Oversubscribed refers to a situation in a securities offering where the demand from investors exceeds the number of securities available for sale. For example, if a company plans to issue 1 million shares of stock but receives subscription requests for 2 million shares, the stock is considered to be oversubscribed. Oversubscription is often seen as a sign of strong market interest and confidence in the security, which can lead to an increase in the offering price. In cases of oversubscription, the issuer typically allocates the available securities on a pro-rata basis or may decide to increase the number of securities offered.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Oversubscription refers to a situation in the securities issuance process where the demand from investors for newly issued securities (such as stocks or bonds) exceeds the number of securities the issuer plans to issue. For example, if a company plans to issue 1 million shares of stock but receives subscription applications totaling 2 million shares, the stock is considered oversubscribed. Oversubscription is usually seen as a sign of strong market interest and confidence in the security, which may lead to an increase in the issuance price. In cases of oversubscription, the issuer typically allocates the applications proportionally or chooses to increase the issuance quantity.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of oversubscription originated in the early development of the securities market when companies raised funds by issuing stocks or bonds. As the market matured and the number of investors increased, oversubscription became more common. Particularly in the late 20th century, with the opening of global capital markets and the development of internet technology, investors could more easily participate in securities issuances worldwide, making oversubscription more frequent.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Oversubscription can be divided into two categories: mild oversubscription and heavy oversubscription. Mild oversubscription refers to subscription applications slightly exceeding the planned issuance quantity, usually not significantly affecting the market price. Heavy oversubscription refers to subscription applications far exceeding the planned issuance quantity, potentially leading to a substantial increase in the issuance price. Characteristics of oversubscription include: 1. Strong market confidence; 2. Potential price increase; 3. Need for proportional allocation or increased issuance quantity.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> 1. In 2014, Alibaba conducted its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, planning to issue 320 million shares but received subscription applications totaling over 1 billion shares, resulting in an oversubscription of more than three times. Due to strong market interest in Alibaba, the issuance price was raised from the initial range of $60-66 to $68. 2. In 2020, Ant Group conducted simultaneous IPOs in Hong Kong and Shanghai, planning to issue about 1.6 billion shares but received subscription applications totaling over 10 billion shares, resulting in an oversubscription of more than six times. Ultimately, Ant Group decided to increase the issuance quantity and allocate the subscription applications proportionally.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <em>Does oversubscription guarantee a profit?</em> Not necessarily. While oversubscription usually indicates strong market interest and confidence, it does not guarantee that investors will make a profit. Factors such as market conditions and company performance will affect the security's performance. 2. <em>How to deal with oversubscription?</em> Investors can choose to buy the security in the secondary market or pay attention to whether the issuer will increase the issuance quantity.</p>`} id={100302} />
