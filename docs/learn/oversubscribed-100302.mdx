Oversubscribed is a term used when the demand for a new issue of stock is greater thanÂ the number of shares available. When a new issue is oversubscribed, underwriters or other financial entities offering the security can adjust the price upward or offer more securities to reflect the higher-than-anticipated demand.An oversubscribed issue can be contrasted with an undersubscribed issue, where demand cannot fully meet the available supply of shares.
