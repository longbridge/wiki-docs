Post-money valuation is a company's estimated worth after outside financing and/or capital injections are added to its balance sheet. Post-money valuation refers to the approximate market value given to a start-up after a round of financing from venture capitalists or angel investors have been completed. Valuations that are calculated before these funds are added are called pre-money valuations. The post-money valuation is equal to the pre-money valuation  the amount of any new equity received from outsideÂ investors.
