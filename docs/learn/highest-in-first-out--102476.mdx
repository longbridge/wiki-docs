Highest in, first out (HIFO) is an inventory distribution and accounting method in which the inventory with the highest cost of purchase is the first to be used or taken out of stock. This will impact the company's books such that for any given period of time, the inventory expense will be the highest possible for the cost of goods sold (COGS), and the ending inventory will be the lowest possible.HIFO usage is rare to non-existent and is not recognized by GAAP.
