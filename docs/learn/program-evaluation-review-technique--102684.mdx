<p>A program evaluation review technique (PERT) chart is a graphical representation of a project's timeline that displays all of the individual&nbsp;tasks necessary to complete the project. Put simply, a PERT chart is a project management tool that allows users to map out a project's timeline and itemize individual tasks. This means that the PERT chart allows users to communicate project instructions and set schedules and timelines for projects among other things.</p>

Simply put, a PERT chart is a project management tool that allows users to map out the project's schedule and list the various tasks. This means that PERT charts enable users to communicate project instructions, set the project's timeline, and track progress.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> PERT charts were first developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s to manage the Polaris missile project. The goal was to improve project efficiency and success rates through better planning and control of project schedules. Over time, PERT charts have been widely adopted in various industries for project management.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> PERT charts are mainly divided into two types: Activity-on-Node (AON) and Activity-on-Arrow (AOA). AON charts use nodes to represent activities and arrows to show dependencies between activities; AOA charts use arrows to represent activities and nodes to indicate events or milestones. Key characteristics of PERT charts include: 1. Identifying the project's critical path, which helps determine the shortest possible completion time; 2. Providing a visual representation of the project schedule, making it easier to track and adjust; 3. Allowing for `} id={102684} />
