A confidence interval, in statistics, refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times. Analysts often use confidence intervals that contain either 95% or 99% of expected observations. Thus, if a point estimate is generated from a statistical model of 10.00 with a 95% confidence interval of 9.50 - 10.50, it can be inferred that there is a 95% probability that the true value falls within that range.Statisticians and other analysts use confidence intervals to understand the statistical significance of their estimations, inferences, or predictions. If a confidence interval contains the value of zero (or some other null hypothesis), then one cannot satisfactorilyÂ claim that a result from data generated by testing or experimentation is to be attributable to a specific cause rather than chance.
