<p>A hammer is a price pattern in candlestick charting that occurs when a security trades significantly lower than its opening, but rallies within the period to close near the opening price. This pattern forms a hammer-shaped candlestick, in which the lower shadow is at least twice the size of the real body. The body of the candlestick represents the difference between the opening and closing prices, while the shadow shows the high and low prices for the period.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A hammer candlestick is a price pattern in candlestick charts that indicates a security's price dropped significantly during the trading period but eventually closed near the opening price. This pattern forms a hammer-shaped candlestick, where the length of the lower shadow is at least twice the length of the real body. The real body represents the difference between the opening and closing prices, while the shadows show the highest and lowest prices during the period.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the hammer candlestick originated from Japanese candlestick charting techniques, which were invented by Japanese rice traders in the 18th century to record and predict rice price fluctuations. This technique was later introduced to Western financial markets and has become a crucial tool in technical analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Hammer candlesticks are mainly divided into two categories: bullish hammer and bearish hammer. A bullish hammer typically appears at the end of a downtrend, indicating a potential reversal signal; a bearish hammer appears at the end of an uptrend, indicating a potential reversal signal. The main characteristics of a hammer candlestick are a long lower shadow and a short real body, indicating that the price dropped significantly during the trading period but eventually recovered most of the losses.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: On a particular trading day, a stock opened at $100, dropped to a low of $80 during the day, but eventually closed at $98. This forms a hammer candlestick, indicating that buyers were actively purchasing at lower prices, potentially signaling a price reversal. Case 2: On another trading day, a stock opened at $50, dropped to a low of $40, but eventually closed at $48. This also forms a hammer candlestick, indicating increased market demand for the stock at lower prices.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does a hammer candlestick always indicate a price reversal? Not necessarily. A hammer candlestick is just a potential reversal signal, and investors should use other technical indicators for comprehensive analysis. 2. How to distinguish a hammer candlestick from other similar candlestick patterns? The key feature of a hammer candlestick is a long lower shadow and a short real body, with the lower shadow being at least twice the length of the real body.</p>`} id={100066} />
