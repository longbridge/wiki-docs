<p>Lease option, or lease with option to purchase, is a type of contract for real property (such as a house) or personal property (such as a car) that grants the lessee the option to buy the property at the end of the lease period. Different from a lease purchase contract, a lease option only binds the lessor to sell but gives the lessee the right to choose to buy. When the term expires, the tenant must exercise the option or forfeit it. If the buyer decides not to purchase, they can choose not to exercise the purchasing right and walk away.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A lease option, also known as a lease with an option to purchase, is a contract for real estate (such as houses) or personal property (such as cars) that grants the lessee the option to purchase the property at the end of the lease term. Unlike a lease-purchase agreement, a lease option only obligates the lessor to sell, but gives the lessee the right to choose to buy. At the end of the term, the tenant must either exercise the option or forfeit it. If the buyer decides not to purchase, they can choose not to exercise the purchase right and leave.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of lease options originated in the early 20th century, initially applied in the real estate market. Over time, this form of contract gradually expanded to personal property such as cars and equipment. Its development was primarily to provide flexible leasing and purchasing options to meet the needs of different customers.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Lease options are mainly divided into two categories: real estate lease options and personal property lease options. Real estate lease options are typically used for houses and commercial properties, characterized by longer lease terms and purchase prices determined at the time of contract signing. Personal property lease options are often used for cars and equipment, with relatively shorter lease terms and purchase prices that may adjust based on market conditions. Both types share the common feature of high flexibility, allowing the lessee to decide whether to purchase at the end of the lease term.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Mr. Wang leases a car with a lease option included in the contract. At the end of the lease term, Mr. Wang can choose to purchase the car at the agreed price in the contract. If the market price rises, Mr. Wang can buy the car at a lower price; if the market price falls, he can choose not to purchase. Case 2: Ms. Li leases an apartment with a lease option included in the contract. At the end of the lease term, Ms. Li can choose to purchase the apartment at the agreed price in the contract. If the property price rises, Ms. Li can buy the property at a lower price; if the property price falls, she can choose not to purchase.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is the purchase price in a lease option fixed? It is usually determined at the time of contract signing but may adjust based on market conditions. 2. Is there a penalty for not exercising the purchase right? Generally, there is no penalty, but specific terms should be referenced in the contract. 3. What is the difference between a lease option and a lease-purchase agreement? A lease option only grants the lessee the right to choose to purchase, while a lease-purchase agreement requires the lessee to purchase.</p>`} id={101274} />
