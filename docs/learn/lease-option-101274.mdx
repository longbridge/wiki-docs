<p>Lease option, or lease with option to purchase, is a type of contract for real property (such as a house) or personal property (such as a car) that grants the lessee the option to buy the property at the end of the lease period. Different from a lease purchase contract, a lease option only binds the lessor to sell but gives the lessee the right to choose to buy. When the term expires, the tenant must exercise the option or forfeit it. If the buyer decides not to purchase, they can choose not to exercise the purchasing right and walk away.</p>
