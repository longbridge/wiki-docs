Rising interest rates refer to an upward trend in the level of interest rates in the market, usually caused by factors such as central bank interest rate hikes and economic growth. Rising interest rates will have a negative impact on borrowers, as borrowing costs will increase, while savers will have a positive impact as they can earn higher savings rates.
