An income property refers to a piece of real estate that is purchased or developed primarily in order to earn income by renting or leasing it out to others, with a secondary goal of price appreciation. Income properties, which are a subset of investment properties, may be either residential or commercial.Investors must take several factors into consideration—such as interest rates and the housing market environment—before purchasing an income property, as there can be unique risks associated with this kind of investment.
