A bear spread is an options strategy used when one is mildly bearish and wants to maximize profit while minimizing losses. The goal is to net the investor a profit when the price of the underlying security declines. The strategy involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of either puts or calls for the same underlying contract with the same expiration date but at different strike prices.A bear spread may be contrasted with a bull spread, which is utilized by investors expecting moderate increases in the underlying security.
