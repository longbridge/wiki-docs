<p>A Warranty of Title is a legal assurance provided typically by the seller in a transaction, guaranteeing that they have the legal ownership of the goods or property being sold. Specifically, the seller promises that they hold clear and legitimate title to the goods or property, and that there are no undisclosed encumbrances, liens, or claims from third parties. The purpose of a warranty of title is to protect the buyer from future ownership disputes or legal issues. If it turns out that the seller did not have legitimate ownership, the buyer is entitled to seek compensation or other legal remedies.</p>
