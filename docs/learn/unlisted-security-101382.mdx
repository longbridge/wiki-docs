<p>An unlisted security refers to a financial instrument that is not traded on a formal stock exchange. These securities are typically bought and sold through over-the-counter (OTC) markets rather than on public exchanges. Unlisted securities can include stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other financial instruments. Because these securities are not traded on public markets, they often have lower liquidity, less price transparency, and may involve higher risks and costs in trading. Investors need to be particularly cautious about the credit risk and market risk associated with unlisted securities.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Unlisted Securities</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Unlisted securities refer to financial instruments that are not traded on a stock exchange. These securities are typically bought and sold through over-the-counter (OTC) markets rather than on public exchanges. Unlisted securities may include stocks, bonds, derivatives, and more. Because these securities are not traded on public markets, they usually have lower liquidity, less price transparency, and may involve higher risks and costs. Investors need to pay special attention to credit risk and market risk when purchasing unlisted securities.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of unlisted securities originated with the development of financial markets, particularly in the early 20th century. As financial instruments diversified and investment demand increased, OTC markets gradually formed. These markets provided a trading platform for companies and financial instruments that could not or did not wish to list on public exchanges.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Unlisted securities can be categorized as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Unlisted Stocks:</strong> These are typically issued by private companies and are not traded on public markets.

What are the main risks of unlisted securities?</strong><br/>The main risks of unlisted securities include liquidity risk, credit risk, and market risk. Since these securities are not traded on public markets, investors may find it difficult to find buyers or sellers, leading to liquidity risk. Additionally, the issuer's credit status can affect the value of the securities, increasing credit risk.</p><p><strong>2.
