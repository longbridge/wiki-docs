A variable price limit is a type of circuit breaker used to maintain orderly trading conditions. It is associated with the commodities futures markets, which are known for their occasionally high levels of volatility.Once a given futures contract has reached its limit price, the exchange may allow its trading to resume within an expanded upper and lower bound of prices. Those new minimum and maximum prices are known as its variable price limits.
