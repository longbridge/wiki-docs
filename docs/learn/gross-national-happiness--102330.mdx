Gross national happiness (GNH) is a measure of economic and moral progress that the king of the Himalayan country of Bhutan introduced in the 1970s as an alternative to gross domestic product. Rather than focusing strictly on quantitative economic measures, gross national happiness takes into account an evolving mix of quality-of-life factors.The kingdom of Bhutan's first legal code, written at the time of unification in 1729, stated that â€œif the government cannot create happiness for its people, there is no purpose for the government."
