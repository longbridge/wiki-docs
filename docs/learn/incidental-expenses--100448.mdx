Incidental expenses are gratuities and other minor costs that are incurred while conducting business, in addition to major expenses such as hotel fees and ticket prices.Incidental expenses ancillary to the costs of transportation, meals, and lodging are common when an employee travels for business. An employee who takes a taxi from the airport to a hotel will incur expenses for taxis and hotels and incidental expenses such as tips to the taxi driver and hotel staff.Other minor expenses like haircuts or toiletries are likely to be categorized as personal since they would have been needed and paid for at home anyway.
