In mutual funds, a folio number is a unique number identifying your account with the fund. Like a bank account number, the folio number can be used as a way to uniquely identify fund investors. A folio number also records items such as how much money each investor has placed with the fund, their transaction history, and contact details.A folio number can also be used to identify journal entries or parcels of land. Different fund houses and providers of similar folio numbers will all use a slightly different method to create a number value.
