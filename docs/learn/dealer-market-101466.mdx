<p>A dealer market is a&nbsp;financial market mechanism wherein multiple dealers post prices at which they will buy or sell a specific security or instrument. In a dealer market, a dealer (who is designated as a “market maker”) provides liquidity and transparency by electronically displaying the prices at which it is willing to make a market in a security, indicating both the price at which it will buy the security (the “bid” price) and the price at which it will sell the security (the “offer” price).</p><p>Bonds and foreign exchanges trade primarily in dealer markets, and stock trading on the Nasdaq is a prime example of an equity dealer market.</p>
