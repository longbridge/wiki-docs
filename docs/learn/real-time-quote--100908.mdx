A real-time quote (RTQs) is the display of the actual price of a security at that very moment in time. Quotes are the price of a stock or security displayed on various websites and ticker tapes. In most cases, these figures are not real-time numbers of where the securities are trading but are delayed quotes. Delayed quotes, unlike real-time quotes, may lag the real trading market by between 15 and 20 minutes. Real-time quotes are instantaneous with no delay.
