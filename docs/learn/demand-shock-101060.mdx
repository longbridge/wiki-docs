A demand shock is a sudden unexpected event that dramatically increases or decreases demand for a product or service, usually temporarily. A positive demand shock is a sudden increase in demand, while a negative demand shock is a decrease in demand. Either shock will have an effect on the prices of the product or service.A demand shock may be contrasted with a supply shock, which is a sudden change in the supply of a product or service that causes an observable economic effect.Supply and demand shocks are examples of economic shocks.
