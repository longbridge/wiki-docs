<p>Free Cash Flow (FCF) is the net cash flow generated by a company after deducting capital expenditures (such as purchases of equipment, infrastructure development, etc.). It represents the cash available for distribution to investors, creditors, and shareholders after maintaining and expanding the company's asset base. Free cash flow is a crucial indicator of a company's financial health and sustainability, helping investors assess the company's true profitability and cash-generating capacity.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Free Cash Flow (FCF) refers to the net cash flow of a company after deducting capital expenditures (such as equipment purchases, infrastructure construction, etc.). It reflects the amount of cash available for distribution to investors, creditors, and shareholders after the capital expenditures needed to maintain and expand its asset base. Free cash flow is an important indicator of a company's financial health and sustainability, helping investors assess the company's actual profitability and cash generation ability.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of free cash flow was widely applied in corporate financial analysis in the 1980s. As capital markets developed, investors and analysts realized that relying solely on net profit to assess a company's financial status was insufficient, as net profit could be affected by accounting treatments and non-cash items. Free cash flow, as a more direct and realistic financial indicator, gradually gained widespread acceptance and use.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Free cash flow can be divided into two categories: Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) and Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF).<ul><li><strong>Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):</strong> Used to assess shareholder returns. The formula is: FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures - Changes in Working Capital + Net Borrowing.</li><li><strong>Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):</strong> Used to assess the value of the entire firm. The formula is: FCFF = EBIT(1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures - Changes in Working Capital.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A manufacturing company had a net income of 5 million yuan in 2023, depreciation and amortization of 1 million yuan, capital expenditures of 2 million yuan, changes in working capital of 0.5 million yuan, and net borrowing of 0.2 million yuan. Its Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) is calculated as follows: FCFE = 5 + 1 - 2 - 0.5 + 0.2 = 3.7 million yuan.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A tech company had an EBIT of 8 million yuan in 2023, a tax rate of 25%, depreciation and amortization of 1.5 million yuan, capital expenditures of 3 million yuan, and changes in working capital of 1 million yuan. Its Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) is calculated as follows: FCFF = 8 * (1 - 0.25) + 1.5 - 3 - 1 = 3.5 million yuan.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is free cash flow more important than net profit?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Free cash flow is more important because it reflects the actual amount of cash generated by the company, whereas net profit can be affected by accounting treatments and non-cash items.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How can a company increase its free cash flow?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> A company can increase its free cash flow by increasing revenue, reducing costs, optimizing capital expenditures, and managing working capital efficiently.</li></ul></p>`} id={228} />
