Effective gross income (EGI) is the Potential Gross Rental Income plus other income minus vacancy and credit costs of a rentalÂ property.EGI can be calculated by taking the potential gross income from an investment property, add other forms of income generated by that property, and subtract vacancy and collection losses.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>Effective Gross Income (EGI) refers to the total income from a rental property, including potential gross rental income and other income, minus vacancy and credit costs. EGI is a crucial metric for evaluating the return on property investments.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of Effective Gross Income originated in real estate investment analysis to provide a more accurate method of income assessment. As the real estate market evolved, investors needed more precise tools to evaluate the actual income potential of properties, making EGI a standard evaluation metric.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Potential Gross Income:</strong> This is the total rental income of a property if fully rented, without considering vacancy and collection losses.<br/>2. <strong>Other Income:</strong> Includes additional income generated by the property, such as parking fees, laundry fees, and advertising revenue.<br/>3. <strong>Vacancy and Credit Costs:</strong> Vacancy costs refer to the income loss from unoccupied units, and credit costs refer to the loss from tenants not paying rent.<br/>The characteristic of EGI is that it comprehensively considers all income sources and potential losses of a property, providing a more holistic income assessment.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>Case 1: A residential building has a potential gross income of $1,000,000, other income of $200,000, and vacancy and credit costs of $100,000. The EGI for this building would be:<br/>EGI = $1,000,000 + $200,000 - $100,000 = $1,100,000.<br/>Case 2: A commercial property has a potential gross income of $2,000,000, other income of $300,000, and vacancy and credit costs of $200,000. The EGI for this property would be:<br/>EGI = $2,000,000 + $300,000 - $200,000 = $2,100,000.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>What is the difference between EGI and potential gross income?</strong><br/>Potential gross income is the total income of a property if fully rented, while EGI considers the actual income after accounting for vacancy and credit costs.<br/>2. <strong>How can vacancy and credit costs be reduced?</strong><br/>Improving property management, selecting quality tenants, and signing long-term leases can effectively reduce vacancy and credit costs.</p>`} id={101724} />
