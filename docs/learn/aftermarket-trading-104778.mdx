Aftermarket trading refers to trading activities that take place after the exchange's normal business hours. In the US stock market, normal business hours are from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm every Monday to Friday. Trading activities after this time period are referred to as aftermarket trading or extended trading. Participants in aftermarket trading are usually institutional investors and individual investors. Unlike normal trading, aftermarket trading has lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations.

As the news is released before regular trading hours, investors quickly react in pre-market trading, leading to significant price fluctuations in the company's stock.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>What are the risks of aftermarket trading?<br/>Due to lower trading volume, reduced liquidity, and higher price volatility, investors face greater risks in aftermarket trading.</li><li>Can individual investors participate in aftermarket trading?<br/>Yes, with the development of electronic trading platforms, individual investors can participate in aftermarket trading, but they should be aware of the associated risks.</li></ul></p>`} id={104778} />
