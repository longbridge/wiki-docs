The interim report is a financial report that publicly discloses a company's semi-annual performance. It includes the financial data and performance of the company for the first six months of the year. The interim report is an important way for companies to provide information to investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders, and can be used to evaluate the company's operating condition and investment value.
