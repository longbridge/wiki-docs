The term positive economics refers to the objective analysis in the study of economics. Most economists look at what has happened and what is currently happening in a given economy to form their basis of predictions for the future. This investigative process is positive economics. Conversely, a normative economic study bases future predictions on value judgments.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Positive economics refers to the objective analysis in economic research. It involves observing and analyzing the actual conditions and data of specific economies to describe and predict economic phenomena without involving value judgments or subjective opinions. The goal of positive economics is to provide fact-based economic analysis to better understand the mechanisms of economic operations.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of positive economics can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when economics gradually separated from philosophy and ethics to become an independent science. The works of early economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo laid the foundation for positive economics, emphasizing the understanding of economic phenomena through observation and data analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Positive economics can be divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics studies the behavior and decisions of individual economic units (such as consumers and firms), while macroeconomics focuses on the operation of the entire economy (such as national income, unemployment rate, and inflation). The characteristics of positive economics are its objectivity and empirical nature, emphasizing analysis through data and facts without involving subjective value judgments.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. Economists predict future inflation rates by analyzing historical data. This prediction is based on past economic data and trends without involving value judgments on whether inflation is “good” or “bad.” 2. Studying the actual impact of a policy (such as minimum wage laws). Economists evaluate the policy's effects on employment rates and wage levels through data analysis without discussing whether the policy “should” be implemented.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is positive economics completely objective? While positive economics emphasizes objective analysis, the selection and interpretation of data may be influenced by the researcher's subjectivity. 2. What is the difference between positive and normative economics? Positive economics focuses on “what is,” while normative economics focuses on “what ought to be,” with the former based on facts and the latter based on value judgments.</p>`} id={101744} />
