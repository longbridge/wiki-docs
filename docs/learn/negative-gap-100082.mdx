<p>A negative gap is a situation where a financial institution's interest-sensitive liabilities exceed its interest-sensitive assets. A negative gap is not necessarily a bad thing, because if interest rates decline, the entity's liabilities are repriced at lower interest rates. In this scenario, income would increase. However, if interest rates increase, liabilities would be repriced at higher interest rates, and income would decrease.</p><p>The opposite of a negative gap is a positive gap, where an entity's interest-sensitive assets exceed its interest-sensitive liabilities. The terms of negative and positive gaps, which analyze interest rate gaps, are also known as duration gap.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Negative Gap</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A negative gap occurs when a financial institution's interest-sensitive liabilities exceed its interest-sensitive assets. A negative gap is not necessarily a bad thing because if interest rates fall, the institution's liabilities will be repriced at a lower rate. In this case, income will increase. However, if interest rates rise, the liabilities will be repriced at a higher rate, and income will decrease.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of a negative gap originated in the field of interest rate risk management, particularly during the periods of high interest rate volatility in the 1970s and 1980s. Financial institutions began to pay more attention to the interest sensitivity of their assets and liabilities to better manage interest rate risk.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Negative gaps can be categorized based on the time period, such as short-term negative gaps and long-term negative gaps. A short-term negative gap refers to a situation where interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets over a short period (e.g., within a year), while a long-term negative gap refers to a situation over a longer period (e.g., five years or more). Short-term negative gaps are typically more sensitive to interest rate changes, while long-term negative gaps may involve more complex interest rate risk management strategies.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A bank has a large amount of short-term deposits (interest-sensitive liabilities) and long-term loans (interest-sensitive assets) on its balance sheet. If market interest rates fall, the bank's deposit rates will quickly decrease, while loan rates remain unchanged, thereby increasing the bank's net interest income.</p><p>Case 2: An insurance company holds a large amount of long-term bonds (interest-sensitive assets) and short-term liabilities. If market interest rates rise, the value of the company's bonds will decrease, while the cost of its liabilities will increase, thereby reducing the company's net interest income.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Is a negative gap always risky?<br/>Answer: Not necessarily. A negative gap can bring benefits when interest rates fall but can pose risks when interest rates rise.</p><p>2. How can negative gap risk be managed?<br/>Answer: Financial institutions can manage negative gap risk by adjusting the structure of their assets and liabilities, using derivatives, and other strategies.</p>`} id={100082} />
