Delivered ex-ship (DES) was a trade term that required a sellerÂ to deliver goods to a buyer at an agreed port of arrival. The seller assumed the full cost and risk involved in getting the goods to that point. After arrival, the seller was considered to have met its obligation and the buyer assumed all ensuing costs and risks.This term applied to both inland and sea shipping and often in charter shipping. It expired effective 2011.
