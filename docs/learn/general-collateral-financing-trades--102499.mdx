General collateral financing (GCF) trades are a type of repurchase agreement (repo) that is executed without the designation of specific securities as collateral until the end of the trading day. GCF trades utilize several inter-dealer brokers, who act as intermediaries for the GCF trades. GCF trades allow both borrowers and lenders in the repo market to reduce their costs and decrease the complexity of handling securities and fund transfers for repo agreements.
