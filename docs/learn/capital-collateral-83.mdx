Deposited capital guarantee is the funds that a company deposits in a bank to ensure the smooth operation of its business. Deposited capital guarantee is usually in the form of a deposit, where a company can deposit a certain amount of funds in a bank as collateral to obtain more credit and financing support according to its own needs.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Capital Deposit Margin refers to the funds deposited by a company in a bank to ensure the smooth operation of its business. Typically, this is a form of margin where a company can deposit a certain amount of money in the bank as a guarantee to obtain more credit and financing support.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of Capital Deposit Margin originated from the need for financial institutions to manage corporate credit risk. As corporate financing needs increased, banks began requiring companies to provide a certain amount of funds as a guarantee to reduce loan risks. This practice became widespread in the mid-20th century, becoming an important tool for corporate financing.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Capital Deposit Margin can be divided into fixed deposit margin and current deposit margin. Fixed deposit margin usually has a fixed deposit term and higher interest rates, suitable for companies with long-term capital needs. Current deposit margin offers more flexibility, allowing companies to withdraw funds as needed, but with lower interest rates. The choice between the two depends on the company's liquidity needs and cost considerations.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A manufacturing company, to secure a long-term loan from a bank, deposited a sum as a fixed deposit margin. Through this method, the company successfully obtained a loan at a lower interest rate, supporting the expansion of its production line. Case Study 2: A tech company, facing short-term cash flow issues, opted to deposit part of its funds as a current deposit margin in a bank. This allowed the company to quickly access funds when needed, maintaining business flexibility.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face include how to choose the appropriate type of deposit and whether the Capital Deposit Margin will affect the company's liquidity. Typically, companies need to decide on the deposit type based on their funding needs and liquidity status. Additionally, Capital Deposit Margin may occupy part of the company's liquid funds, so careful planning is required.</p>`} id={83} />
