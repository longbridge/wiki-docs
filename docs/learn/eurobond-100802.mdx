A Eurobond is a debt instrument that's denominated in a currency other than the home currency of the country or market in which it is issued. Eurobonds are frequently grouped together by the currency in which they are denominated, such as eurodollar or Euro-yen bonds. Since Eurobonds are issued in an external currency, they're often called external bonds. Eurobonds are important because they help organizations raise capital while having the flexibility to issue them in another currency.Issuance of Eurobonds is usually handled by an international syndicate of financial institutions on behalf of the borrower, one of which may underwrite the bond, thus guaranteeing the purchase of the entire issue.
