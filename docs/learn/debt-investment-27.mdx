<p>Debt investment refers to the purchase of debt instruments (such as bonds, loans, accounts receivable, etc.) by investors to earn fixed or predictable interest income and principal repayment. Debt investments are typically considered more conservative compared to equity investments because they usually provide regular interest payments and carry lower risk. The returns from debt investments primarily come from interest income and the repayment of principal at maturity.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Debt investment refers to the purchase of debt instruments (such as bonds, loans, accounts receivable, etc.) by investors to obtain fixed or predictable interest income and principal repayment. Debt investments are generally considered more conservative because they typically offer regular interest payments and lower risk compared to equity investments. The returns from debt investments mainly come from interest income and principal repayment at maturity.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The origin of debt investment can be traced back to ancient times when lending activities were already present. With the development of financial markets, the bond market began to form in 17th-century Europe, particularly in the Netherlands and the UK. The expansion and complexity of the modern bond market began in the 20th century, as governments and corporations issued bonds to raise funds.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Debt investments can be categorized into government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. Government bonds are usually considered the safest as they are backed by national credit. Corporate bonds carry higher risk and return, depending on the issuing company's credit status. Municipal bonds are issued by local governments, typically for public project financing. Key features of debt investments include fixed interest payments, principal repayment at maturity, and relatively low market volatility.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>A typical example is U.S. Treasury bonds, considered one of the safest investments globally due to being backed by the U.S. government. Investors earn regular interest income and principal repayment at maturity by purchasing these bonds. Another example is corporate bonds issued by Apple Inc., where investors support the company's operations and expansion while earning interest income.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors in debt investments may face interest rate risk, where rising interest rates can lead to falling bond prices. Credit risk is also a concern, especially in corporate bonds, where the issuing company may fail to meet its debt obligations. Investors should carefully assess the bond's credit rating and market conditions.</p>`} id={27} />
