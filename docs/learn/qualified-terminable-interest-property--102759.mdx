A qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust enables the grantor to provide for a surviving spouseÂ and maintain control of how the trust's assets are distributed once the surviving spouse dies. Income generated from the trust, and sometimes the principal, is given to the surviving spouse to ensure that the spouse is taken care of for the rest of their life.
