A vertical spread involves the simultaneous buying and selling of options of the same type (i.e., either puts or calls) and expiry, but at different strike prices. The term 'vertical' comes from the position of the strike prices.This is in contrast to a horizontal, or calendar spread, which is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same option type with the same strike price, but with different expiration dates.
