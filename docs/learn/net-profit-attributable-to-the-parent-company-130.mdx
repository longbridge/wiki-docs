Net profit attributable to the parent company refers to the net profit that belongs to the owner of the parent company. In enterprises jointly owned by subsidiaries and parent companies, the net profit attributable to the subsidiary company is shared with the owner of the parent company according to the proportion it holds.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Net profit attributable to the parent company refers to the net profit that belongs to the shareholders of the parent company. In enterprises jointly owned by a subsidiary and a parent company, the proportion of net profit of the subsidiary is shared with the shareholders of the parent company. It is an important indicator to measure the actual profit obtained by the parent company in the entire group.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of net profit attributable to the parent company gradually formed with the development of enterprise groupization and multinational operations. Early financial statements mainly focused on the profitability of a single enterprise, but as the corporate structure became more complex, especially with the widespread existence of parent-subsidiary relationships, financial statements needed to reflect the actual earnings of the parent company within the entire group.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Net profit attributable to the parent company is mainly divided into two categories: one is the net profit from the parent company's own business, and the other is the net profit from the subsidiary's business. The former directly reflects the operating conditions of the parent company, while the latter needs to consider the equity relationship between the subsidiary and the parent company. The characteristic of net profit attributable to the parent company is that it can comprehensively reflect the profitability of the parent company within the entire group, avoiding the one-sidedness of looking at the financial data of the parent company or subsidiary alone.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Parent company A holds 60% of the shares of subsidiary B, and subsidiary B achieves a net profit of 10 million yuan in a certain year. The net profit attributable to the parent company is 60% of 10 million yuan, which is 6 million yuan. Case 2: Parent company C has multiple subsidiaries, each achieving different net profits. Parent company C needs to calculate the net profit attributable to the parent company by summing up the net profits of each subsidiary according to the shareholding ratio.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why is net profit attributable to the parent company more important than net profit? Net profit attributable to the parent company can better reflect the actual profitability of the parent company within the entire group. 2. How to calculate net profit attributable to the parent company? It is necessary to calculate the part of the net profit of each subsidiary that belongs to the parent company according to the shareholding ratio of the parent company in each subsidiary.</p>`} id={130} />
