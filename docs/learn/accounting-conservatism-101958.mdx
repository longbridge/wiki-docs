Accounting conservatism is a set of bookkeeping guidelines that call for a high degree of verification before a company can make a legal claim to any profit. The general concept is to factor in the worst-case scenario of a firmâ€™s financial future. Uncertain liabilitiesare to be recognized as soon as they are discovered. In contrast, revenues can only be recorded when they are assured of being received.
