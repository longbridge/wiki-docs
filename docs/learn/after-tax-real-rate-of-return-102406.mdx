The after-tax real rate of return is the actual financial benefit of an investment after accounting for the effects of inflation and taxes. It is a more accurate measure of an investorâ€™s net earnings after income taxes have been paid and the rate of inflation has been adjusted for. Both of these factors must be accounted for because they impact the gains an investor receives. This can be contrasted with the gross rate of return and the nominal rate of return of an investment.
