<p>A low volume pullback refers to a temporary reversal in the price of a security or market during an uptrend or downtrend, accompanied by lower-than-average trading volume. This type of pullback is often considered a healthy market correction, as it indicates a lack of significant selling or buying pressure against the prevailing trend, suggesting that market participants still have confidence in the current trend. Traders and investors typically view low volume pullbacks as opportunities to add to their positions in the direction of the main trend, as such pullbacks may signal the continuation of the trend.</p>
