Home equity is the value of a homeowner’s financial interest in their home. In other words, it is the actual property’s current market value less any liens that are attached to that property. The amount of equity in a house fluctuates over time as more payments are made on the mortgage and market forces impact the property's current value.Home equity can represent more than a mortgage loan being paid off. It is an asset that homeowners can borrow against to meet important financial needs such as paying off high-cost debt or paying college tuition.The interest rate on home equity-based borrowing is typically lower than that on credit cards and personal loans because the funds are secured by the equity. So the equity in your home can be a smart source of funds. Plus, interest on such borrowing is generally tax deductible if funds are used to improve the home.
