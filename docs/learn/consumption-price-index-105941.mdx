The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an indicator that measures the price changes of a basket of goods and services purchased by households during a certain period of time. CPI is often used to measure the level and impact of inflation. The calculation method of CPI includes selecting a certain quantity and type of representative goods and services, and then calculating the index based on the price changes of these goods and services. The changes in CPI reflect the price changes of goods and services, thereby affecting the purchasing power and cost of living for households.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living. By tracking the changes in prices of these representative items, the CPI reflects the overall price level changes, thereby affecting the purchasing power and living costs of households.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of CPI dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when governments began to pay attention to the impact of inflation on the economy. The United States first published official CPI data in 1919, and other countries followed suit, adopting this indicator to monitor and analyze economic conditions.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>CPI is typically divided into two main categories: headline CPI and core CPI. Headline CPI includes all items, while core CPI excludes food and energy prices due to their volatility. While headline CPI provides a comprehensive view of price changes, core CPI is often used to gauge long-term inflation trends.</p><p>Additionally, CPI can be broken down into various categories of goods and services, such as food, housing, transportation, and healthcare. The impact of each category on the overall CPI depends on its weight in the consumer's expenditure.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose a countryâ€™s headline CPI was 100 in January 2023 and rose to 105 in January 2024. This indicates that the cost of purchasing the same basket of goods and services increased by 5% over the year, resulting in an inflation rate of 5%.</p><p>Case 2: In a particular quarter, food prices might surge due to natural disasters, while energy prices drop. The headline CPI might show significant fluctuations, whereas the core CPI could remain relatively stable as it excludes the volatile food and energy prices.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why doesn't CPI include house prices?<br/>Answer: CPI focuses on the prices of consumer goods and services, while house prices are generally considered investment goods. To more accurately reflect living costs, CPI usually includes rent or equivalent rent for owner-occupied housing instead of house prices.</p><p>2. Can CPI accurately reflect an individual's cost of living?<br/>Answer: CPI is an average measure that reflects overall price level changes. Since individual consumption habits and structures vary, CPI may not fully capture the changes in living costs for every individual.</p>`} id={105941} />
