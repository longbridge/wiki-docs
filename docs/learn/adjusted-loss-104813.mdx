Adjusted loss refers to the net profit of a company after adjusting for some non-recurring gains and losses when calculating net profit. Such adjustments typically include some non-recurring gains and losses, such as restructuring costs, impairment losses, non-recurring donations, etc.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Adjusted loss refers to the net profit of a company after adjusting for certain non-recurring gains and losses. These adjustments typically include non-recurring items such as restructuring costs, impairment losses, and non-recurring donations. This adjustment allows investors to better understand the company's operating conditions and profitability.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of adjusted loss originated from the need for financial statement analysis. As business activities became more complex, relying solely on net profit was insufficient to fully reflect a company's true operating conditions. By the late 20th century, with the development of financial analysis techniques, adjusted loss became a common financial metric.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Adjusted loss can be categorized into the following types:<ul><li><strong>Restructuring Cost Adjustments:</strong> Costs incurred during company restructuring, such as severance payments and asset disposal losses.</li><li><strong>Impairment Loss Adjustments:</strong> Losses due to the decline in asset value, such as fixed asset impairments and goodwill impairments.</li><li><strong>Non-recurring Donation Adjustments:</strong> Costs from non-recurring donations or charitable activities.</li></ul>These adjustments are characterized by their non-recurring nature and typically do not have a lasting impact on the company's long-term profitability.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> In 2023, a company underwent a major restructuring, incurring $5 million in restructuring costs. Without adjustments, the company's net profit would be $2 million. After adjustments, the net profit excluding restructuring costs would be $7 million.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> In 2024, a manufacturing company discovered an impairment loss of $3 million on one of its fixed assets. Without adjustments, the company's net profit would be $1 million. After adjustments, the net profit excluding the impairment loss would be $4 million.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why make adjustments?</strong> Adjusted loss can exclude the impact of non-recurring gains and losses, providing a more accurate reflection of the company's operating conditions and profitability.</li><li><strong>Is adjusted loss more reliable?</strong> While adjusted loss can offer a clearer financial picture, investors should still consider other financial metrics for a comprehensive analysis.</li></ul></p>`} id={104813} />
