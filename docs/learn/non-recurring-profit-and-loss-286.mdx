Non-recurring profit or loss refers to the profit or loss that occurs outside of normal operating activities for a company. These profit or loss are usually caused by special events or non-routine transactions, such as non-recurring income or expenses. Non-recurring profit or loss can affect a company's operating performance, so it needs to be paid attention to in financial analysis and comparison.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-recurring gains and losses refer to the gains and losses that occur outside the normal business activities of a company. These gains and losses are usually due to special events or irregular transactions, such as non-recurring income or expenses. Non-recurring gains and losses can affect a company's operating performance, so they need to be considered in financial analysis and comparison.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-recurring gains and losses originated from the need for financial accounting to distinguish the impact of regular business activities from that of occasional events on financial statements. In the mid-20th century, as financial statement analysis became more complex, non-recurring gains and losses were gradually clarified and standardized.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-recurring gains and losses can be divided into non-recurring income and non-recurring expenses. Non-recurring income includes gains from asset sales, government grants, etc.; non-recurring expenses include asset impairment losses, natural disaster losses, etc. Their characteristics are unpredictability, high incidence, and minimal impact on the company's long-term operating performance, but they may significantly affect financial statements in the short term.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company gains a substantial profit from selling an idle piece of land. This profit is considered non-recurring income because it is not part of the company's regular business activities. Case 2: A manufacturing company incurs significant losses due to a sudden fire that destroys equipment. This loss is considered a non-recurring expense.</p><p><strong>Common Issues:</strong> Investors often overlook the impact of non-recurring gains and losses when analyzing a company's financial statements, leading to misjudgments about the company's operating performance. Another common issue is that companies may use non-recurring gains and losses for financial manipulation, exaggerating or concealing actual operating results.</p>`} id={286} />
