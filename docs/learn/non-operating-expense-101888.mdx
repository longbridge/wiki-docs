A non-operating expense is a business expense unrelated to core operations. The most common types of non-operating expenses are interest charges and losses on the disposition of assets. Accountants sometimes remove non-operating expenses and non-operating revenues to examine the performance of the core business, excluding the effects of financing and other items.Non-operating expenses can be contrasted with operating expenses, which relate to the day-to-day functioning of a business.
