In economics, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the amount of a good that a consumer is willing to consume compared to another good, as long as the new good is equally satisfying.MRS is used in indifference theory to analyze consumer behavior. When someone is indifferent to substituting one item for another, their marginal utility for substitution is zero since they neither gain nor lose any satisfaction from the trade.
