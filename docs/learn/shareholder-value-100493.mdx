Shareholder value is the value delivered to the equity owners of a corporation, thanks to management’s ability to increase sales, earnings, and free cash flow, which leads to an increase in dividends and capital gains for shareholders.A company’s shareholder value depends on strategic decisions that its board of directors and senior management make, including the ability to make wise investments and generate a healthy return on invested capital. If this value is created, particularly over the long term, then the share price increases and the company can pay larger cash dividends to shareholders. Mergers, in particular, tend to cause a large increase in shareholder value.Shareholder value can become a hot-button issue for corporations, as the creation of wealth for shareholders does not always or equally translate to value for the corporation’s employees or customers.
