An institutional investor is a company or organization that invests money on behalf of other people. Mutual funds, pensions, and insurance companies are examples. Institutional investors often buy and sell substantial blocks of stocks, bonds, or other securities and, for that reason, are considered to be the whales on Wall Street.The group is also viewed as more sophisticated than the average retail investor and, in some instances, they are subject to less restrictive regulations.
