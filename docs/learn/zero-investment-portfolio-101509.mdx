A zero-investment portfolio is a collection of investments that hasÂ a net value of zero when the portfolio is assembled, and therefore requires an investor to take no equity stake in the portfolio. For instance, an investor may short sell $1,000 worth of stocks in one set of companies, and use the proceeds to purchase $1,000 in stock in another set of companies.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A zero-investment portfolio is an investment portfolio that has a net value of zero at the time of formation. Therefore, investors do not need to hold any equity in the portfolio. For example, an investor can short sell a group of stocks worth $1,000 and use the proceeds to buy another group of stocks worth $1,000.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of a zero-investment portfolio originated from modern portfolio theory and has been widely used in hedge funds and arbitrage trading. Its purpose is to reduce market risk by holding both long and short positions simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Zero-investment portfolios are mainly divided into two categories: market-neutral strategies and arbitrage strategies. The characteristic of market-neutral strategies is to eliminate the impact of market fluctuations by holding equal amounts of long and short positions, thereby achieving stable returns. Arbitrage strategies, on the other hand, profit from market mispricing by buying undervalued assets and selling overvalued assets. Both strategies share the common feature of requiring no additional capital investment and having relatively low risk.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: An investor finds that Tech Stock A is overvalued while Tech Stock B is undervalued. He shorts $5,000 worth of Tech Stock A and uses the proceeds to buy $5,000 worth of Tech Stock B. If the price of Tech Stock A falls and the price of Tech Stock B rises, the investor will profit. Case 2: A hedge fund manager discovers an arbitrage opportunity between two companies' stocks. He shorts $2,000 worth of Company X's stock and uses the proceeds to buy $2,000 worth of Company Y's stock. If the price of Company X's stock falls and the price of Company Y's stock rises, the fund manager will profit.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is a zero-investment portfolio completely risk-free? Answer: A zero-investment portfolio is not completely risk-free. While it can reduce market risk, it still carries individual stock risk and liquidity risk. 2. Is a zero-investment portfolio suitable for all investors? Answer: Zero-investment portfolios are generally suitable for investors with some investment experience and risk tolerance. Beginners may need more learning and practice.</p>`} id={101509} />
