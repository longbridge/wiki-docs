<p>A unilateral contract is a type of contract where only one party makes a promise or undertakes an obligation, while the other party is not required to make any promise or take any action. Typically, a unilateral contract is formed when one party makes an offer, and the contract becomes effective only when the other party performs a specific act. For example, a reward advertisement is a unilateral contract: the advertiser promises to pay a reward, and the contract becomes effective when someone performs the specified act, such as finding a lost pet. The key aspect of a unilateral contract is that the obligation is only triggered upon the completion of the specified act.</p>
