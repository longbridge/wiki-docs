A unilateral contract is a one-sided contract agreement in which an offeror promises to pay only after the completion of a task by the offeree. In this type of agreement, the offeror is the only party with a contractual obligation. A unilateral contract differs from a bilateral contract in which both parties are bound by the agreement.
