Adjusted EBITDA refers to the value obtained by adjusting the factors such as interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization in the profit when calculating the profit of a company. This indicator can be used to evaluate the operating status and profitability of a company, as it eliminates the impact of some non-operating factors on profits.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) refers to the value obtained after adjusting the profit by excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This metric is used to evaluate a company's operating performance and profitability, as it eliminates the impact of some non-operating factors on profit.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of EBITDA first appeared in the 1980s, primarily used in leveraged buyout (LBO) transactions to assess a company's cash flow generation capability. Over time, Adjusted EBITDA has been widely adopted across various industries and companies to provide a clearer view of operating performance.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Adjusted EBITDA is typically adjusted based on the specific circumstances of the company, with common adjustments including one-time expenses, restructuring costs, and non-cash charges. Its characteristic is to more accurately reflect the company's operating condition by excluding non-recurring and non-cash items.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. A tech company reports a net profit of $5 million in its quarterly financial report, but due to a one-time restructuring expense of $2 million, the Adjusted EBITDA is $7 million. 2. A manufacturing company, when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, excludes $1 million in non-cash depreciation expenses and $500,000 in non-recurring legal expenses, making the Adjusted EBITDA more reflective of its actual operating performance.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why use Adjusted EBITDA instead of net profit? Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-operating and non-cash items, providing a more accurate reflection of the company's operating condition. 2. Is Adjusted EBITDA completely reliable? While Adjusted EBITDA offers a clearer view of operating performance, it should still be analyzed in conjunction with other financial metrics.</p>`} id={105572} />
