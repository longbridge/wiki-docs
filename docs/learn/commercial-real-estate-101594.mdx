Commercial real estate (CRE) is property used exclusivelyÂ for business-related purposes or to provide a workspace rather than a living space, which would instead constitute residential real estate.

It can be anything from an office building to a residential duplex, or even a restaurant, coffee shop, or warehouse. Individuals, companies, and corporate interests can make money from commercial real estate by leasing it out, or holding it and reselling it.Commercial real estate includes several categories, such as retailers of all kinds: office space, hotels and resorts, strip malls, restaurants, and healthcare facilities.
