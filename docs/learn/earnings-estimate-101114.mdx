An earnings estimate is an analyst's estimate for a company's future quarterly or annual earnings per shareÂ (EPS). Future earnings estimates are arguably the most important input when attempting to value a firm. By placing estimates on the earnings of a firm for certain periods (quarterly, annually, etc.), analysts can then use cash flow analysis to approximate fair value for a company, which in turn will give a target share price.Investors often rely on earnings estimates to analyze different stocks and decide whether to buy or sell them.
