The down payment ratio refers to the ratio of the down payment amount paid by the home buyer to the total value of the house. The down payment ratio is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, a down payment ratio of 30% means that the home buyer needs to pay 30% of the total value of the house as a down payment. The down payment ratio is an important indicator of the purchasing power and loan demand of home buyers. A higher down payment ratio means that the home buyer needs to pay more cash, reducing the loan amount and interest expenses, while also reducing the buyer's risk exposure.
