An interest rate floor is an agreed-upon rate in the lower range of rates associated with a floating rate loan product. Interest rate floors are utilized in derivative contracts and loan agreements. This is in contrast to an interest rateÂ ceiling (or cap).Interest rate floors are often used in the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) market. Often, this minimum is designed to cover any costs associated with processing and servicing the loan. An interest rate floor is often present through the issuing of an ARM, as it prevents interest rates from adjusting below a preset level.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The interest rate floor refers to the minimum interest rate that a floating-rate loan product cannot fall below.
