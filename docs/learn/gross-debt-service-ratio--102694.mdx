<p>The gross debt service (GDS) ratio is a debt service measure that financial lenders use to assess the proportion of housing debt that a borrower is paying in comparison to their income. The gross debt service ratio is one of several metrics used to qualify borrowers for a mortgage loan and determine the amount of principal offered.</p><p>The gross debt service ratio may also be referred to as the housing expense ratio or the front-end ratio. Generally, borrowers should strive for a gross debt service ratio of 28% or less.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio is a debt repayment capacity indicator used by financial lenders to assess the proportion of a borrower's income that goes towards housing debt. The GDS ratio is one of several indicators used to evaluate a borrower's mortgage eligibility and determine the principal amount offered. The GDS ratio is also known as the housing expense ratio or front-end ratio. Generally, borrowers should aim to keep their GDS ratio at 28% or below.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the GDS ratio originated in the mid-20th century when financial institutions began systematically assessing borrowers' repayment capacities to reduce loan default risks. As the housing loan market developed, this ratio gradually became an important tool for evaluating borrowers' credit risk.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The GDS ratio is mainly divided into two categories: the front-end ratio and the back-end ratio. The front-end ratio (GDS) considers only housing-related debts, such as mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance. The back-end ratio (TDS) includes all debts, such as credit card debt and car loans. The front-end ratio focuses on housing expenses and is used to assess the risk of home loans, while the back-end ratio provides a more comprehensive assessment of the debt burden.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Xiao Ming has a monthly income of 10,000 yuan, and his housing-related expenses (including mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance) are 2,500 yuan. Xiao Ming's GDS ratio is 2,500/10,000 = 25%, which meets the general recommendation of being below 28%. Case 2: Xiao Hong has a monthly income of 8,000 yuan, and her housing-related expenses are 3,000 yuan. Xiao Hong's GDS ratio is 3,000/8,000 = 37.5%, exceeding the recommended 28%, which may affect her loan application.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why is the GDS ratio important? Answer: It helps financial institutions assess a borrower's repayment capacity, reducing loan default risks. 2. How can one lower the GDS ratio? Answer: Increase income or reduce housing-related expenses, such as choosing a cheaper property or cutting unnecessary insurance.</p>`} id={102694} />
