<p>Non-negotiable refers to certain documents, instruments, or assets that cannot be transferred or endorsed to another party. This means the ownership of these assets or instruments cannot be simply transferred through signature or delivery, but must be handled according to specific rules or procedures. Common examples of non-negotiable documents include certain types of checks, bonds, or stock certificates. This arrangement is typically used to ensure the security of assets or funds and to prevent unauthorized transfer or circulation.</p>
