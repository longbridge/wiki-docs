A FICO score is a credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO). Lenders use borrowers’ FICO scores along with other details on borrowers’ credit reports to assess credit risk and determine whether to extend credit.FICO scores take into account data in five areas to determine a borrower's credit worthiness: payment history, the current level of indebtedness, types of credit used, length of credit history, and new credit accounts.
