Securitization pools assets and repackages them into interest-bearing securities. An issuer designs a marketable financial instrument by merging financial assets, commonly mortgage loans or consumer or commercial debt. Investors that purchase these securities receive the principal and interest payments of the underlying assets.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Securitization is the process of pooling various types of financial assets and repackaging them into interest-bearing securities. Issuers create marketable financial instruments by combining financial assets (typically mortgages, consumer, or commercial debt).

This process allowed more funds to flow into the real estate market, promoting the widespread availability of home loans.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Securitization can be divided into several types, mainly including Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), Asset-Backed Securities (ABS), and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS).<ul><li><strong>Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):</strong> Composed of residential mortgages, investors receive principal and interest payments from homeowners by purchasing MBS.</li><li><strong>Asset-Backed Securities (ABS):</strong> Composed of various types of consumer debt (such as credit card debt, auto loans), investors receive repayments of these debts by purchasing ABS.</li><li><strong>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS):</strong> Composed of commercial real estate loans, investors receive repayments of commercial real estate loans by purchasing CMBS.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A bank pools 1,000 residential mortgages into MBS and sells these MBS to investors.
