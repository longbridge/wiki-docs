Passive income refers to income that individuals or companies obtain without actively working, through investments, rentals, franchise rights, and other means. It is in contrast to active income, such as wages and salaries, which require actual work or the provision of services to earn. Passive income can be achieved through investments in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets, as well as through leasing and franchising. Passive income typically has stability and sustainability, and can provide additional economic sources for individuals or companies.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Passive Income</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Passive income refers to earnings derived from investments, rental properties, royalties, and other sources that do not require active involvement. Unlike active income, such as wages and salaries, which require actual work or services, passive income can be generated through investments in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets, as well as through leasing and franchising. Passive income is typically stable and sustainable, providing an additional economic source for individuals or businesses.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of passive income dates back to ancient times when landlords earned rent by leasing land without actively farming it. With the development of financial markets, investing in stocks and bonds became a significant source of modern passive income. The rise of franchising and intellectual property in the mid-20th century further diversified the forms of passive income.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Passive income can be categorized into the following types:</p><ul><li><strong>Investment Income:</strong> Earnings from holding financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, which generate interest or dividends. This type of income involves both risk and reward, suitable for investors with some financial knowledge.</li><li><strong>Rental Income:</strong> Earnings from leasing real estate, equipment, or other assets. This type of income is relatively stable but requires asset management and maintenance.</li><li><strong>Franchise Income:</strong> Earnings from licensing one's brand or business model to others. This type of income involves significant initial investment but offers stable returns in the long run.</li><li><strong>Intellectual Property Income:</strong> Earnings from selling or licensing patents, copyrights, and other intellectual properties. This type of income relies on innovation and creativity.</li></ul><h3>Case Studies</h3><p><strong>Case 1: Stock Investment</strong><br/>John buys shares of well-known companies and receives annual dividends from these companies. Although stock prices fluctuate, the dividend income is relatively stable, providing a source of passive income for him.</p><p><strong>Case 2: Real Estate Leasing</strong><br/>Jane purchases an apartment and rents it out, receiving a fixed monthly rental income. Although she needs to handle tenant issues and property maintenance, the rental income provides her with a stable cash flow.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>1. Does passive income require no management at all?</strong><br/>While passive income does not require daily work like active income, it still needs some level of management and maintenance. For example, investments need regular market monitoring, and real estate requires tenant management and property upkeep.</p><p><strong>2. Is passive income completely risk-free?</strong><br/>Passive income is not entirely risk-free. Investments in stocks and bonds may face market volatility, real estate may face vacancy risks, and franchises may face market competition, among other risks.</p>`} id={107298} />
