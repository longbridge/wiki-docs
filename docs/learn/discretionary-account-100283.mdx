<p>A Discretionary Account, also known as a Managed Account, is an investment account where the client grants permission to a financial advisor or broker to make investment decisions on their behalf, without needing prior approval for each transaction. These accounts are typically managed by professional investment managers who devise and execute investment strategies based on the client's investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation. The advantage of a discretionary account lies in its ability to quickly react to market changes and leverage professional expertise for investment decisions, but it also requires a high level of trust in the investment manager.</p>
