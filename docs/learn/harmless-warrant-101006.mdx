The term harmless warrant refers to a provision that requires bondholders to surrender an existing bond if they want to purchase the same type of bond from the issuer. Put simply, bond issuers put harmless warrants on their bonds, requiring investors to swap their existing bond if they want to purchase another one with similar features from the same issuer. Harmless warrants are a safety net for bond issuers as they help keep their debt levels in check.
