<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other intangible assets refer to all intangible assets owned by a company, excluding goodwill. Intangible assets are non-financial assets that cannot be touched, seen, or held, such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Other intangible assets may include special technologies, proprietary technologies, patents, trademark rights, copyrights, and invention rights.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of intangible assets gradually formed with the development of the knowledge economy. In the late 20th century, with the rise of technology and information industries, companies began to recognize the value of intangible assets. The accounting treatment and reporting of intangible assets became standardized in the 1980s.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other intangible assets can be categorized into various types, including technology-related (e.g., patents, proprietary technologies), brand-related (e.g., trademarks, brand names), and creation-related (e.g., copyrights, design rights). Their features include invisibility, immateriality, longevity, and potential economic benefits. They are widely applied in technology, culture, and brand management fields. The advantage is that they can provide long-term benefits to companies, but the disadvantage is the difficulty in accurately assessing their value.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: Microsoft has established a strong market position and competitive advantage through its patent portfolio and software copyrights. These intangible assets have provided Microsoft with a continuous revenue stream and market influence. Case Study 2: Coca-Cola's brand value is one of its most important intangible assets. Through trademark and brand management, Coca-Cola has maintained strong brand recognition and loyalty in the global market.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often face challenges in accurately assessing the value of other intangible assets and how to reflect these assets in financial statements. A common misconception is that the value of intangible assets is fixed, whereas in reality, their value may fluctuate with market changes.</p>`} id={38} />
