Deferred income refers to the economic benefits that are unable to be recognized as income or expenses within a certain accounting period, but are postponed for recognition as income or expenses through deferral processing. Deferred income can be both deferred revenue and deferred expenses.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Deferred Revenue</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Deferred revenue refers to the economic benefits that a company cannot recognize as income or expenses within a certain accounting period, and thus defers the recognition to a later period. Deferred revenue can be either deferred income or deferred expenses.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of deferred revenue originates from the matching principle and revenue recognition principle in accounting. The matching principle requires companies to recognize expenses in the same period as the related revenues, while the revenue recognition principle stipulates that revenue should be recognized when it is realized. To more accurately reflect a company's financial status and operating results, the method of handling deferred revenue was gradually introduced and standardized.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Deferred revenue mainly falls into two categories: deferred income and deferred expenses.</p><ul><li><strong>Deferred Income:</strong> Refers to income that a company has received but has not yet provided the corresponding services or goods. Examples include prepaid rent and membership fees. This type of income needs to be recognized gradually in future accounting periods.</li><li><strong>Deferred Expenses:</strong> Refers to expenses that a company has paid but has not yet received the corresponding services or goods. Examples include prepaid insurance and advertising fees. This type of expense needs to be amortized gradually in future accounting periods.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1: Prepaid Rent</strong><br/>On January 1, 2024, a company received a year's rent in advance totaling 120,000 yuan. According to accounting standards, the company needs to record this amount as deferred income and recognize 10,000 yuan of rental income each month over the next 12 months.</p><p><strong>Case 2: Prepaid Insurance</strong><br/>On January 1, 2024, a company paid a year's insurance premium totaling 24,000 yuan. According to accounting standards, the company needs to record this amount as deferred expenses and amortize 2,000 yuan of insurance expenses each month over the next 12 months.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>1. Why is deferred revenue necessary?</strong><br/>Deferred revenue helps to more accurately reflect a company's financial status and operating results, avoiding the distortion of financial statements caused by recognizing income or expenses all at once.</p><p><strong>2. How does deferred revenue affect financial statements?</strong><br/>Deferred revenue affects both the balance sheet and the income statement. Deferred income is recorded as a liability until it is recognized, while deferred expenses are recorded as an asset until they are amortized.</p>`} id={270} />
