A horizontal acquisition is when one company acquires another company in the same industry and works at the same production stage. The new combined entity may be in a better competitive position due to increased market share or scalability than the standalone companies combined to form it.During a horizontal acquisition, a company can expand its production of products, but it doesn't mean a pivot for the company. Horizontal acquisitions expand the capacity of the acquirer, but the basic business operations remain the same, unlike an acquisition that creates a wholly different company.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Horizontal acquisition refers to a company acquiring another company in the same industry and at the same production stage. Through this method, the newly merged entity may have a better competitive position due to increased market share or scalability, which are formed by the merger of independent companies.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of horizontal acquisition originated in the early 20th century during the industrialization process, when many companies expanded their market share and production capacity by acquiring competitors in the same industry. As market competition intensified, horizontal acquisition gradually became an important strategy for companies to expand and consolidate their market position.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Horizontal acquisitions can be divided into two categories: full acquisition and partial acquisition. Full acquisition means the acquirer fully controls the acquired company, while partial acquisition means the acquirer only obtains a portion of the acquired company's equity. The main characteristics of horizontal acquisition include: 1. Increasing market share; 2. Improving production efficiency; 3. Reducing competitive pressure; 4. Expanding product lines.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. In 2016, AB InBev acquired SABMiller for approximately $103 billion. This horizontal acquisition made AB InBev the largest beer producer in the world, significantly expanding its market share. 2. In 2019, Disney acquired 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets for $71.3 billion. This acquisition not only enhanced Disney's competitiveness in the entertainment industry but also expanded its content library.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does horizontal acquisition lead to monopoly? While horizontal acquisition can increase market share, market regulators may block the acquisition if they believe it will lead to a monopoly. 2. Are horizontal acquisitions always successful? Not all horizontal acquisitions are successful; factors such as cultural differences and inconsistent management styles can lead to integration failure.</p>`} id={100565} />
