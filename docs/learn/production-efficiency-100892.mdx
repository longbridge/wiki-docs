Production efficiency is an economic term describing a level at which an economy or entity can no longer produce additional amounts of a good without lowering the production level of another product. This happens when production is reportedly occurring along aÂ production possibility frontier (PPF).Production efficiency may also be referred to as productive efficiency. Productive efficiency similarly means that an entity is operating at maximum capacity.
