<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(0,0,0,0.05)",color:"rgb(36,41,47)"}}>An Underlying Security refers to the asset or security on which a financial derivative (such as options, futures, swaps, etc.) is based. It forms the foundation of the derivative's value. For example, the underlying security of a stock option is a specific stock, and the underlying security of an index future is a specific stock index. Underlying securities can include various asset types, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indices. Investors trade derivatives based on the underlying securities to achieve purposes like hedging, speculation, or arbitrage. Understanding the characteristics and market performance of the underlying security is crucial for the effective use of derivatives.</span></p>
