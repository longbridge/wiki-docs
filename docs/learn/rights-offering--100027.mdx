<p>A rights issue is a method by which a company offers existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares of the company's stock in proportion to their current holdings. This is a way for the company to raise funds, often for business expansion, debt repayment, or other capital needs. The new shares are typically offered at a discount to the market price to encourage participation. Shareholders can either exercise these rights to buy the new shares or sell the rights to other investors. If shareholders choose not to participate, their ownership percentage in the company may be diluted.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Rights issue refers to the right given by a company to its existing shareholders to purchase newly issued shares in proportion to their current holdings. This is a way to raise funds, usually for business expansion, debt repayment, or other capital needs. The rights issue price is typically lower than the market price to attract existing shareholders to participate. Shareholders can choose to exercise these rights to buy new shares or sell these rights to other investors. If shareholders choose not to participate in the rights issue, their ownership percentage may be diluted.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of rights issue originated in the 19th century in the UK, where companies offered existing shareholders the right to purchase new shares to raise funds. As capital markets developed, this method was gradually adopted by companies worldwide.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Rights issues can be divided into two main types: 1. <strong>Open rights issue</strong>: The company offers the right to purchase new shares to all existing shareholders. 2. <strong>Directed rights issue</strong>: The company offers the right to purchase new shares only to specific shareholders or investors. The main characteristics of rights issues include: 1. <strong>Discounted price</strong>: The rights issue price is usually lower than the market price. 2. <strong>Dilution effect</strong>: If shareholders do not participate in the rights issue, their ownership percentage will be diluted. 3. <strong>Fundraising</strong>: Rights issues are an effective way for companies to raise funds.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. <strong>Case 1:</strong> A company announces a rights issue at a price of 10 yuan per share, while the market price is 15 yuan. Existing shareholders can purchase new shares at a lower price in proportion to their current holdings. 2. <strong>Case 2:</strong> A company conducts a directed rights issue, offering the right to purchase new shares only to major shareholders to ensure their control is not diluted.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <strong>What is the difference between a rights issue and a public offering?</strong> A rights issue offers existing shareholders the right to purchase new shares, while a public offering involves the company issuing new shares directly to the market. 2. <strong>What happens if I do not participate in a rights issue?</strong> If you do not participate in a rights issue, your ownership percentage will be diluted, but you can choose to sell your rights.</p>`} id={100027} />
