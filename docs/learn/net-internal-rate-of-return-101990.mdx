Net internal rate of return (net IRR) is a performance measurement equal to the internal rate of return after fees and carried interest are factored in. It is used in capital budgeting and portfolio management to calculate an investment's yield or overall financial quality by calculating an expected rate of return.Practically, net IRR is the rate at which the net present value ofÂ negative cash flow equals the net present value of positive cash flow. A net internal rate of return is expressed as a percentage.
