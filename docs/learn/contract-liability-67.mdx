<p>Contract liability refers to the obligation of a company to provide goods or services to a customer for which the company has already received payment or for which the customer has already paid but the company has not yet fulfilled its part of the agreement. This type of liability is recorded on the company's balance sheet and indicates the company's future obligation to deliver goods or services under the contract.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Contract liability refers to the obligation a company incurs when it receives advance payments from customers or when customers have paid but the company has not yet fulfilled its corresponding obligations. This liability reflects the company's responsibility to provide goods or services to customers in the future. Contract liabilities are typically listed on a company's balance sheet, indicating unfulfilled contractual obligations.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of contract liability has evolved with the development of accounting standards, particularly under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States. Its purpose is to more accurately reflect a company's financial position and performance obligations.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Contract liabilities can be categorized into short-term and long-term. Short-term contract liabilities are expected to be fulfilled within a year, while long-term contract liabilities take longer. Their features include: 1. Reflecting future performance obligations of the company; 2. Affecting the company's liquidity and financial health; 3. Requiring clear disclosure in financial statements.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A software company lists contract liabilities on its financial statements after receiving annual subscription fees from customers but before providing the corresponding software services. Case 2: A construction company records contract liabilities on its balance sheet after receiving advance payments for a project that has not yet been completed.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common questions from investors include: Does contract liability affect a company's cash flow? The answer is that contract liability itself does not directly affect cash flow but indicates future cash outflows. Another question is whether contract liability implies poor financial health. In reality, contract liability is a normal part of business operations, reflecting the company's performance obligations.</p>`} id={67} />
