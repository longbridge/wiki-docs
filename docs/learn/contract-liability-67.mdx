<p>Contract liability refers to the obligation of a company to provide goods or services to a customer for which the company has already received payment or for which the customer has already paid but the company has not yet fulfilled its part of the agreement. This type of liability is recorded on the company's balance sheet and indicates the company's future obligation to deliver goods or services under the contract.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Contract liability refers to the liability that arises when a company receives advance payments from customers or when customers have paid but the company has not yet fulfilled its obligations. This liability reflects the company's responsibility to provide goods or services to customers in the future.
