A medium-term note (MTN) is a note that usually matures in five to 10 years. A corporate MTN can be continuously offered by a company to investors through a dealer with investors being able to choose from differing maturities, ranging from nine months to 30 years, though most MTNs range in maturity from one to 10 years.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Medium-Term Notes (MTNs) are debt instruments that typically mature in five to ten years. Companies can continuously offer notes with varying maturities to investors through dealers, with maturities ranging from nine months to thirty years, but most MTNs have terms of one to ten years.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of MTNs originated in the United States in the 1980s when companies began issuing these flexible debt instruments to meet diverse financing needs. Over time, MTNs have gained widespread use globally, becoming an important tool for corporate financing.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> MTNs can be classified based on different criteria. By interest rate type, there are fixed-rate and floating-rate MTNs; by issuance method, there are publicly issued and privately placed MTNs. Fixed-rate MTNs have a constant interest rate throughout their term, suitable for risk-averse investors; floating-rate MTNs have interest rates that adjust with market rates, suitable for investors sensitive to market rate changes. Publicly issued MTNs offer high transparency and liquidity, while privately placed MTNs have lower issuance costs but relatively lower liquidity.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A large manufacturing company plans to raise 500 million RMB to expand its production line. The company issues a series of MTNs through dealers, with terms of 3, 5, and 7 years, and interest rates of 3.5%, 4.0%, and 4.5%, respectively. This approach not only successfully raises the needed funds but also optimizes the company's debt structure. Case 2: A tech company decides to issue MTNs to fund new product development. The company opts for floating-rate MTNs with a 5-year term and an initial interest rate of 3.0%, adjusting every six months based on market rates. Given the expected rise in market rates over the next few years, this strategy effectively reduces the company's financing costs.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What are the risks of investing in MTNs? Answer: The main risks include credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. 2. How do MTNs differ from long-term bonds? Answer: MTNs typically have terms of 1 to 10 years, while long-term bonds usually have terms exceeding 10 years.</p>`} id={101751} />
