A weighted average is a calculation that takes into account the varying degrees of importance of the numbers in a data set. In calculating a weighted average, each number in the data set is multiplied by a predetermined weight before the final calculation is made. A weighted average can be more accurate than a simple average in which all numbers in a data set are assigned an identical weight.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Weighted Average</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A weighted average is a calculation method that considers the varying importance of numbers in a data set. In calculating the weighted average, each number in the data set is multiplied by a predetermined weight before the final calculation. Compared to a simple average where all numbers are given equal weight, a weighted average can be more accurate.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of weighted average can be traced back to the early development of statistics and mathematics. It was first used in economics and finance to more accurately reflect the impact of different factors on overall results. With the development of data analysis and statistical methods, weighted average has become a common calculation tool.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Weighted averages can be divided into several types, mainly including arithmetic weighted average and geometric weighted average. The arithmetic weighted average is the most common type, and its calculation formula is:<br/> <code>Weighted Average = (w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + ... + wn * xn) / (w1 + w2 + ... + wn)</code><br/>where <code>w</code> represents the weight and <code>x</code> represents the data value. The geometric weighted average is used for data sets with multiplicative relationships, and its calculation formula is:<br/> <code>Geometric Weighted Average = (x1^w1 * x2^w2 * ... * xn^wn)^(1/(w1 + w2 + ... + wn))</code></p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Stock Portfolio<br/>Suppose you have a portfolio containing three stocks, A, B, and C, with the following investment amounts and weights:<br/>Stock A: Investment $1000, Weight 0.5<br/>Stock B: Investment $500, Weight 0.3<br/>Stock C: Investment $500, Weight 0.2<br/>The weighted average investment amount is:<br/> <code>(1000 * 0.5 + 500 * 0.3 + 500 * 0.2) / (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2) = $750</code></p><p>Case 2: Student Grades<br/>Suppose a student's final grade is composed of homework, midterm exam, and final exam, with weights of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5, respectively. The student's grades are 80, 85, and 90. The weighted average grade is:<br/> <code>(80 * 0.2 + 85 * 0.3 + 90 * 0.5) / (0.2 + 0.3 + 0.5) = 86.5</code></p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why use a weighted average?<br/>A weighted average can more accurately reflect the importance of different data points, especially when some data points are more important than others.</p><p>2. How to determine the weights?<br/>The determination of weights usually depends on the specific application scenario and professional knowledge. For example, in a portfolio, weights can be determined based on investment amounts or expected returns.</p>`} id={100619} />
