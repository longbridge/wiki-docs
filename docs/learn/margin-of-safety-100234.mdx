<p>Margin of Safety (MOS) refers to the buffer or cushion that investors maintain to account for uncertainties and risks when evaluating investment opportunities. Specifically, it is the difference between the intrinsic value of a stock or asset and its market price. By purchasing assets at prices lower than their intrinsic value, investors can protect themselves against market fluctuations or valuation errors. The concept of Margin of Safety was first introduced by Benjamin Graham and is a fundamental principle in value investing. It emphasizes the importance of caution and conservatism in investment decisions to minimize potential losses.</p>
