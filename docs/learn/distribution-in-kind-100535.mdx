A distribution-in-kind, also referred to as a distribution-in-specie, is a payment made in the form of securities or other property rather than in cash. A distribution-in-kind may be made in several different situations, including the payment of a stock dividend or inheritance, or taking securities out of a tax-deferred account. It can also refer to the transfer of an asset to a beneficiary over the option of liquidating the position and transferring the cash.
