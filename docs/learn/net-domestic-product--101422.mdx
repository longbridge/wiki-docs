Net domestic product (NDP) is an annual measure of the economic output of a nation that is calculated by subtracting depreciation from gross domestic productÂ (GDP).

<AIContent content={`<h2>Net Domestic Product (NDP)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Net Domestic Product (NDP) is an economic measure of a country's annual output. It is calculated by subtracting depreciation (capital consumption) from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). NDP reflects the actual increase in economic value within a country over a specific period.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of Net Domestic Product originated in the mid-20th century as economists began to focus more on economic growth and capital consumption. NDP was introduced to provide a more accurate reflection of a country's economic health, as GDP does not account for capital depreciation.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>1. <strong>Nominal NDP</strong>: NDP calculated at current market prices, without adjusting for inflation.</p><p>2. <strong>Real NDP</strong>: NDP calculated at base year prices, adjusted for inflation, providing a clearer picture of actual economic growth.</p><p>Characteristics: NDP offers a more accurate reflection of a country's economic health compared to GDP, as it accounts for capital depreciation, giving a truer picture of economic growth.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose a country has a GDP of $1 trillion in 2023 and depreciation of $200 billion. The NDP would be $800 billion, indicating the actual economic value added in 2023.</p><p>Case 2: If a country has a GDP of $1.2 trillion in 2024 and depreciation of $250 billion, the NDP would be $950 billion. Comparing the NDP of 2023 and 2024 shows the country's economic growth.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. <strong>Why is NDP more important than GDP?</strong> NDP accounts for capital depreciation, providing a truer picture of economic growth.</p><p>2. <strong>How is NDP calculated?</strong> NDP = GDP - Depreciation.</p><p>3. <strong>What is the impact of depreciation?</strong> Depreciation reflects the consumption and aging of capital equipment, affecting actual economic output.</p>`} id={101422} />
