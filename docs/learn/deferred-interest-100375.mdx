<p>Deferred Interest refers to interest that has accrued but has not yet been paid during a specific period and will be paid at a future date. This term is often seen in loan agreements or bond issuances as a financial tool that allows the borrower to defer interest payments to a later period, thereby reducing initial cash outflows. This arrangement can help borrowers manage their financial burden in the early stages, but it might result in a higher total interest payment over time, as the unpaid interest can continue to accrue and generate additional interest.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Deferred interest refers to interest that accrues over a period but is not paid until a future date. This type of interest is commonly found in loan agreements or bond issuances, serving as a financial tool that allows borrowers to reduce cash outflows in the initial stages and defer interest payments.
