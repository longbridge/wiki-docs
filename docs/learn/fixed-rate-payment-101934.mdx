A fixed-rate payment is an installment loan with an interest rate that cannot be changed during the life of the loan. The payment amount also will remain the same, though the proportions that go toward paying off the interest and paying off the principal will vary.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fixed-rate payment is a type of installment loan where the interest rate remains unchanged throughout the loan term. The payment amount also remains constant, although the proportion used to pay interest and principal will vary. Fixed-rate payments are sometimes referred to as 'vanilla' payments because they are very predictable and have no surprises.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of fixed-rate loans dates back to the early 20th century when banks began offering this form of loan to meet the needs of homebuyers and businesses.

Long-term fixed-rate loans usually have a term of 15 to 30 years, with higher interest rates but lower monthly payments.
