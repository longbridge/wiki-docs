The P/E 10 ratio is a valuation measure generally applied to broad equity indices that use real per-share earnings over 10 years. The P/E 10 ratio also uses smoothed real earnings to eliminate the fluctuations in net income caused by variations in profit margins over a typical business cycle. The P/E 10 ratio is also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio or the Shiller PE ratio.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Price-to-Earnings Ratio 10 (P/E 10) is a valuation metric commonly applied to composite stock indices. It uses the actual earnings per share (EPS) over the past 10 years to calculate the P/E ratio, smoothing out the fluctuations in net income caused by changes in profit margins during typical business cycles. P/E 10 is also known as the Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio (CAPE) or Shiller P/E.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of P/E 10 was introduced by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller. Shiller elaborated on this metric in his book <em>Irrational Exuberance</em>, detailing its calculation method and application. The primary purpose of this metric is to more accurately reflect the long-term valuation level of the stock market, avoiding the impact of short-term earnings volatility on the P/E ratio.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> P/E 10 has the following key characteristics:<ul><li>Smoothing Earnings: By using the actual EPS over the past 10 years, P/E 10 can smooth out short-term earnings volatility, providing a more stable valuation reference.</li><li>Long-term Perspective: P/E 10 emphasizes long-term earning capacity, making it suitable for evaluating the long-term investment value of the market.</li><li>Historical Comparison: P/E 10 can be compared with historical data to help investors determine whether the current market valuation is reasonable.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: During the 2008 financial crisis, the P/E 10 of the S&P 500 index significantly dropped, reflecting the market's pessimistic outlook on future earnings. At this time, the low P/E 10 value provided a potential buying opportunity for investors.</li><li>Case 2: In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, market panic led to a sharp decline in stock prices, but the change in P/E 10 was relatively small because it considered the earnings data of the past 10 years, providing a more stable valuation reference.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Is P/E 10 applicable to all markets? P/E 10 is mainly suitable for mature markets. It may not be as applicable to emerging markets due to their higher earnings volatility and shorter historical data.</li><li>Can P/E 10 predict market trends? P/E 10 is primarily used as a valuation reference and cannot directly predict market trends, but it can help investors determine whether the market is overvalued or undervalued.</li></ul></p>`} id={101611} />
