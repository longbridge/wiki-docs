Negative amortization is a financial term referring to an increase in the principal balance of a loan caused by a failure to cover the interest due on that loan. For example, if the interest payment on a loan is $500, and the borrower only pays $400, then the $100 difference would be added to the loan's principal balance.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Negative amortization is a financial term that refers to the situation where the loan principal balance increases due to the failure to pay the corresponding loan interest. For example, if the interest payment on a loan is $500 and the borrower only pays $400, the difference of $100 will be added to the loan principal balance.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of negative amortization originated in the practice of loan and debt management, especially in situations with high interest rates or tight cash flow for borrowers. It was widely discussed in the mid-20th century and has become a common loan management method as financial markets have developed and become more complex.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Negative amortization mainly falls into two categories: negative amortization in fixed-rate loans and negative amortization in adjustable-rate loans. In fixed-rate loans, negative amortization typically occurs when the borrower cannot pay the fixed interest on time, while in adjustable-rate loans, it may occur due to interest rate fluctuations that the borrower cannot keep up with. The characteristic of negative amortization is that it increases the total cost of the loan and may lead the borrower into deeper debt.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Borrower A has a fixed-rate loan with a monthly interest payment of $500, but due to financial difficulties, A can only pay $400. The remaining $100 is added to the loan principal, increasing the principal balance. Case 2: Borrower B has an adjustable-rate loan, and the interest rate rises from 3% to 5%. B cannot pay the increased interest portion, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal, increasing the loan balance.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does negative amortization affect credit scores? Yes, negative amortization increases the loan balance, which may raise the borrower's debt ratio and affect their credit score. 2. How to avoid negative amortization? Borrowers should try to pay interest on time and in full or negotiate with the lender to adjust the repayment plan.</p>`} id={100085} />
