The joint return test is one of the IRS tests that potential dependents must pass in order to be claimed as such by another taxpayer.The joint return test stipulates that no dependent can file a joint return with a spouse and still be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return, such as that of a parent or guardian. There is, however, an exception to this rule.Because claiming dependents is valuable, the IRS institutes several tests, such as the joint return test, to make sure that dependents aren’t being double-counted.
