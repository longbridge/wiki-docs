<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(255,255,255)",color:"rgb(6,6,7)"}}>The Joint Return Test is one of the criteria established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States to determine whether an individual can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer. According to this test, if a potential dependent files a joint tax return with their spouse, they generally cannot be claimed as a dependent by someone else within the same tax year. This rule is designed to prevent the double-counting of dependents in tax filings.</span></p>
