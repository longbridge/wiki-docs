Technical job skills, sometimes referred to as hard skills, are specific talents and expertise an individual possesses that help them perform a certain task or job. These skills differ from soft skills, which instead describe character and personality traits.Technical skills are abilities an individual acquires through practice and learning, although a person may bring an inherent propensity for a certain skill. An individual who possesses a particular proficiency for coding, for instance, would have a sought-after technical skill as a job candidate at a software or technology company.
