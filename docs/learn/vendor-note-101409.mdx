A vendor note is a short-term loan a vendor makes to a customer that is secured by goods the customer buys from the vendor. A vendor note is classified as a form of "vendor finance" or "vendor financing," which is a type of lending that usually takes the form of a deferred loan made by a vendor. Vendor notes are most likely to be employed when a vendor has more confidence in a customer's business prospects than a traditional lender (a bank) would.
