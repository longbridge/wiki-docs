Net realizable value (NRV) is a valuation method, common in inventory accounting, that considers the total amount of money an asset might generate upon its sale, less a reasonable estimate of the costs, fees, and taxes associated with that sale or disposal.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Net Realizable Value (NRV) is a valuation method commonly used in inventory accounting. It considers the total amount that an asset can generate upon sale, minus a reasonable estimate of the costs, expenses, and taxes associated with that sale or disposal.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Net Realizable Value originates from accounting standards, particularly the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These standards require companies to consider the actual realizable amount of an asset, rather than just its book value, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial statements.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> NRV is primarily applied in the valuation of inventory and accounts receivable.<ul><li><strong>Inventory:</strong> In inventory accounting, NRV is used to determine whether the book value of inventory needs to be written down. If the market value of the inventory is lower than its cost, the company must write down the inventory to its NRV.</li><li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> For accounts receivable, NRV considers potential bad debt losses by subtracting the estimated uncollectible portion from the receivables.</li></ul>The characteristic of NRV is its conservatism principle, which tends to undervalue assets to avoid overestimating the company's financial position.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case One:</strong> A retail company has inventory goods costing $100,000, but due to a decline in market demand, the market price of these goods drops to $90,000. Assuming the related selling expenses are $5,000, the NRV of this inventory is $85,000 ($90,000 - $5,000). The company needs to write down the inventory's book value to $85,000.</li><li><strong>Case Two:</strong> A manufacturing company has accounts receivable of $200,000, but it estimates that $10,000 may be uncollectible. According to the NRV principle, the net realizable value of the accounts receivable is $190,000 ($200,000 - $10,000).</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question One:</strong> Why use Net Realizable Value?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Using NRV provides a more accurate reflection of an asset's actual value, preventing the overestimation of the company's financial position.</li><li><strong>Question Two:</strong> How to determine the related costs and taxes?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Related costs and taxes are usually based on historical data and reasonable estimates, and companies need to make judgments based on specific circumstances.</li></ul></p>`} id={101989} />
