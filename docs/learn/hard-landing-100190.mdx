<p>A hard landing refers to a marked economic slowdown or downturn following a period of rapid growth.&nbsp;</p><p>The term "hard landing" comes from aviation, where it refers to the kind of high-speed landing that—while not an actual crash—is a source of stress as well as potential damage and injury. The metaphor is used for high-flying economies that run into a sudden, sharp check on their growth, such as a monetary policy intervention meant to curb inflation. Economies that experience a hard landing often slip into a stagnant period or even recession.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Economic hard landing refers to a significant economic slowdown or recession following a period of rapid growth. This process is often accompanied by high unemployment rates, business closures, and a sharp decline in market confidence.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The term originates from the aviation field, referring to a high-speed landing that, while not a crash, causes stress, potential damage, and injury. This metaphor is used for high-flying economies when they encounter sudden and severe growth resistance, such as monetary policy interventions to curb inflation. Economies experiencing a hard landing often fall into stagnation or even recession.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Economic hard landings can be categorized as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Monetary policy-induced hard landing:</strong> When central banks raise interest rates or reduce money supply to curb inflation, it can lead to a sharp slowdown in economic activity.</li><li><strong>Fiscal policy-induced hard landing:</strong> Government spending cuts or tax increases to control budget deficits can slow down economic growth.</li><li><strong>External shock-induced hard landing:</strong> For example, a surge in international oil prices or a global financial crisis can cause a sudden economic slowdown.</li></ul><h2>Case Studies</h2><p><strong>Case 1: Japan in the early 1990s</strong><br/>In the late 1980s, Japan experienced a bubble in real estate and stock markets. To curb inflation, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, leading to the bubble's burst and a prolonged economic stagnation, a typical example of an economic hard landing.</p><p><strong>Case 2: The 2008 Global Financial Crisis</strong><br/>The subprime mortgage crisis in the United States triggered a global financial crisis, causing many countries' economies to slow down sharply. Despite emergency measures by governments and central banks, an economic hard landing was unavoidable.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>1. What is the difference between an economic hard landing and a soft landing?</strong><br/>An economic soft landing refers to a gradual slowdown in economic growth without falling into a recession. A hard landing, on the other hand, refers to a sharp slowdown or even a recession.</p><p><strong>2. How can economic hard landings be prevented?</strong><br/>Governments and central banks can prevent economic hard landings through flexible monetary and fiscal policies, enhanced financial regulation, and international cooperation.</p>`} id={100190} />
