Overweight rating refers to the rating given by analysts or investment institutions to a stock or asset, indicating that the stock or asset has a higher proportion in the investment portfolio, exceeding its benchmark index or industry average level. Overweight rating usually means that analysts or investment institutions believe that the stock or asset has good growth potential, and they recommend investors to increase the proportion of holding the stock or asset.
