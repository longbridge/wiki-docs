<p>Loss Given Default (LGD) refers to the proportion of a loan or debt that a lender or creditor expects to lose if the borrower or debtor defaults. LGD is a critical metric in credit risk management, typically expressed as the percentage of the expected loss relative to the total outstanding debt at the time of default. The calculation of LGD considers factors such as the value of collateral, recovery rates, legal costs, and other related expenses, helping financial institutions assess and manage their credit risk.</p><p>Key characteristics include:</p><p>Loss Proportion: LGD represents the expected loss proportion a lender or creditor would face in the event of default.<br/>Credit Risk Management: LGD is a key metric for assessing and managing credit risk, widely used by banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.<br/>Multi-Factor Consideration: Calculating LGD involves considering various factors, such as the value of collateral, recovery rates, and legal costs.<br/>Risk Assessment: Helps financial institutions evaluate the risk level of their loan portfolios and develop appropriate risk management strategies.</p><p><br/>Loss Given Default formula:</p><p>LGD = 1− Recovery&nbsp;Amount/Total&nbsp;Outstanding&nbsp;Debt<br/><br/>where:</p><p>Recovery Amount: The amount recovered through collateral liquidation or other means after default.<br/>Total Outstanding Debt: The total amount of debt outstanding at the time of default.<br/>Example of Loss Given Default application:<br/>Suppose a bank lends $10 million to a company, secured by real estate collateral.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>Loss Given Default (LGD) refers to the proportion of loss that a lender or creditor expects to incur when a borrower or debtor defaults. LGD is a key metric in credit risk management, typically expressed as the percentage of the loss amount over the total outstanding debt at the time of default. The calculation of LGD takes into account factors such as the value of collateral, recovery rates, and legal costs, helping financial institutions assess and manage their credit risk.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of Loss Given Default originated in the 1980s as financial markets evolved and credit risk management became a focal point for financial institutions. Particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, LGD has been widely applied and extensively studied as a crucial measure of credit risk.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Loss Proportion:</strong> LGD represents the proportion of loss that a lender or creditor expects to incur at the time of default.<br/>2. <strong>Credit Risk Management:</strong> LGD is a key metric for assessing and managing credit risk, widely used by banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.<br/>3. <strong>Multi-Factor Consideration:</strong> The calculation of LGD requires consideration of various factors such as the value of collateral, recovery rates, and legal costs.<br/>4. <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> LGD helps financial institutions evaluate the risk level of their loan portfolios and develop corresponding risk management strategies.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>Case 1: Suppose a bank lends 10 million yuan to a company, with real estate as collateral. If the company defaults and the bank recovers 8 million yuan by disposing of the real estate, the LGD would be:<br/>𝐿𝐺𝐷 = 1 − 800/1000 = 0.2<br/>That is, the bank expects to incur a 20% loss.<br/>Case 2: A financial institution issues an unsecured loan of 500,000 yuan to an individual. If the borrower defaults and the institution can only recover 100,000 yuan through legal means, the LGD would be:<br/>𝐿𝐺𝐷 = 1 − 10/50 = 0.8<br/>That is, the institution expects to incur an 80% loss.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>How to accurately calculate LGD?</strong><br/>Accurately calculating LGD requires precise assessment of the value of collateral, recovery rates, and related legal costs, which may involve uncertainties.<br/>2. <strong>How does LGD differ from other credit risk metrics?</strong><br/>LGD focuses on the proportion of loss that may be incurred after default, while other metrics like Probability of Default (PD) focus on the likelihood of default occurring. Using both metrics together provides a more comprehensive assessment of credit risk.</p>`} id={102120} />
