Loss given default (LGD) is the estimated amount of money a bank or other financial institution loses when a borrower defaults on a loan. LGD is depicted as a percentage of total exposure at the time of default or a single dollar value of potential loss. A financial institutionâ€™s total LGD is calculated after a review of all outstanding loans using cumulative losses and exposure.
