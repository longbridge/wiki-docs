Pareto analysis is a technique used for business decision-making, but which also has applications in several different fields from welfare economics to quality control. It is based largely on the "80-20 rule." As a decision-making technique, Pareto analysis statistically separates a limited number of input factors—either desirable or undesirable—which have the greatest impact on an outcome.Pareto analysis is premised on the idea that 80% of a project's benefit can be achieved by doing 20% of the work—or, conversely, 80% of problems can be traced to 20% of the causes. Pareto analysis is a powerful quality and decision-making tool. In the most general sense, it is a technique for getting the necessary facts needed for setting priorities.
