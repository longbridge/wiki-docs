A subprime mortgage is one that’s normally issued to borrowers with low credit ratings. A prime conventional mortgage isn’t offered, because the lender views the borrower as having a greater-than-average risk of defaulting on the loan.Lending institutions often charge interest on subprime mortgages at a much higher rate than on prime mortgages to compensate for carrying more risk. These are often adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) as well, so the interest rate can potentially increase at specified points in time.
