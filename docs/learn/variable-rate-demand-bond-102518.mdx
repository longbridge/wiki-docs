A variable-rate demand bond is a type of municipal bond (muni) with floating coupon payments that are adjusted at specific intervals. The bond is payable to the bondholder upon demand following an interest rate change. Generally, the current money market rate is used to set the interest rate, plus or minus a set percentage, which may result in a change in coupon payments over time.
