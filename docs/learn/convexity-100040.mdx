<p>Convexity is apparent in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields. Convexity is the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and interest rates. It reflects the rate at which the duration of a bond changes as interest rates change. Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It represents the expected percentage change in the price of a bond for a 1% change in interest rates.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style={{width:"60.84%"}}><img src="https://pub.lbkrs.com/social/2024/0/5tsp5qKRTrgsvAng969wEDtmTpvY74Ph.jpg" /></figure>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Convexity reflects the relationship between bond prices and bond yields. It is the curvature of the relationship between bond prices and interest rates. Convexity indicates how the duration of a bond changes as interest rates change. Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes, representing the expected percentage change in bond price for a 1% change in interest rates.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of convexity was first introduced by financial scholars in the mid-20th century to more accurately describe the reaction of bond prices to interest rate changes. As financial markets evolved, convexity became an important tool in bond investment analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Convexity can be divided into positive convexity and negative convexity. Positive convexity means that bond prices are more sensitive to interest rate decreases than increases, commonly found in most plain vanilla bonds. Negative convexity means that bond prices are more sensitive to interest rate increases than decreases, often seen in certain types of bonds like callable bonds. Bonds with positive convexity perform better in highly volatile interest rate environments because their prices react more strongly to interest rate decreases.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: Suppose an investor holds a bond with a duration of 5 years. When market interest rates drop by 1%, the bond price increases by approximately 5%. If the bond has positive convexity, the actual price increase might exceed 5%, for example, reaching 5.2%.</li><li>Case 2: A company issues a callable bond with negative convexity. When market interest rates rise by 1%, the bond price might decrease by more than the expected 5%, for example, reaching 5.5%.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Q: Why is convexity important to bond investors?<br/>A: Convexity helps investors more accurately predict how bond prices will react to changes in interest rates, enabling them to make more informed investment decisions.</li><li>Q: Do all bonds have convexity?<br/>A: Yes, all bonds have convexity, but the degree of convexity varies among different bonds.</li></ul></p>`} id={100040} />
