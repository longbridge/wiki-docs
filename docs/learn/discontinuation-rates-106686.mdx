Termination rate refers to the proportion of activities or services that are stopped or cancelled within a specific period of time. In the financial field, termination rate is often used to describe the proportion of customers or investors terminating contracts, terminating investments, or terminating transactions. Termination rate can be used to evaluate customer loyalty, product or service quality, and changes in market demand. A higher termination rate may indicate problems or dissatisfactory factors, while a lower termination rate may indicate higher customer satisfaction or stable market demand.
