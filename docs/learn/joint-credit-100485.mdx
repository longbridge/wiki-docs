The term joint credit refers to any type of credit facility that is issued to two or more people based on their combined incomes, assets, and credit histories. The parties involved share everything about the debt including the credit limit and the responsibility to repay it back to the lender. Joint credit can be used when one individual has little to no credit or a bad credit report, and when two or more people need access to a large credit limit that they wouldn't qualify for individually.
