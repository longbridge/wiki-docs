The de minimis tax rule sets the threshold at which a discount bond should be taxed as a capital gain rather than as ordinary income. The rule states that a discount that is less than a quarter-point per full year between its time of acquisition and its maturity is too small to be considered a market discount for tax purposes. Instead, the accretion from the purchase price to the par value should be treated as a capital gain, if it is held for more than one year.De minimis is Latin for "about minimal things."

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>De Minimis Tax Rule</strong></p><p><strong>Definition:</strong> The De Minimis Tax Rule refers to the tax treatment of discount bonds where the discount is considered a capital gain rather than ordinary income if the discount between the purchase and maturity dates does not exceed a quarter point. The rule sets the threshold for market discounts that are too small to be considered for tax purposes. Conversely, if the period exceeds one year, the accumulation from the purchase value to the face value is considered a capital gain. 'De minimis' is Latin for 'about minimal things'.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The De Minimis Tax Rule originated in U.S. tax law to simplify the tax treatment of small market discount bonds. The rule was introduced to avoid complex tax calculations for minimal market discounts, thereby improving tax processing efficiency.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The De Minimis Tax Rule primarily applies to discount bonds. Discount bonds are purchased at a price below their face value and are redeemed at face value upon maturity. According to the De Minimis Tax Rule, if the market discount between the purchase and maturity dates does not exceed a quarter point, the discount is considered a capital gain. If it exceeds a quarter point, the discount is considered ordinary income. The rule simplifies the tax treatment of small market discounts, reducing the tax burden on taxpayers.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>Case 1: Suppose Investor A purchases a discount bond with a face value of $100 for $99.75 on January 1, 2023, maturing on January 1, 2024. According to the De Minimis Tax Rule, since the discount is $0.25 (a quarter point), it is considered a capital gain. The $0.25 gain that Investor A receives upon maturity on January 1, 2024, will be treated as a capital gain for tax purposes.</li><li>Case 2: Suppose Investor B purchases a discount bond with a face value of $100 for $99 on January 1, 2023, maturing on January 1, 2024. According to the De Minimis Tax Rule, since the discount is $1 (exceeding a quarter point), it is considered ordinary income. The $1 gain that Investor B receives upon maturity on January 1, 2024, will be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ol><li>Q: Does the De Minimis Tax Rule apply to all types of bonds?<br/>A: The De Minimis Tax Rule primarily applies to discount bonds and does not apply to all types of bonds.</li><li>Q: How is the tax treatment handled if the market discount exceeds a quarter point?<br/>A: If the market discount exceeds a quarter point, the discount is considered ordinary income rather than a capital gain.</li></ol></p>`} id={101850} />
