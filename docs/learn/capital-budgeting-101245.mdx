<p>Capital budgeting is a process that businesses use to evaluate potential major projects or investments. As part of capital budgeting, a company might assess a prospective project's lifetime cash inflows and outflows to determine whether the potential returns it would generate meet a sufficient target benchmark. The capital budgeting process is also known as investment appraisal.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating potential major projects or investments. As part of capital budgeting, a company may assess the cash inflows and outflows of a potential project to determine if it meets sufficient target criteria. The capital budgeting process is also known as investment appraisal.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of capital budgeting originated in the early 20th century, as industrialization progressed and companies needed systematic evaluation and decision-making for large projects. In the 1950s, with the development of modern financial theory, capital budgeting methods were further refined and popularized.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Capital budgeting mainly includes the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> Evaluates a project's value by calculating the present value of future cash flows minus the initial investment. The advantage is that it considers the time value of money; the disadvantage is that it requires accurate cash flow predictions.</li><li><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR):</strong> Finds the discount rate that makes the project's net present value zero. The advantage is that it is intuitive and easy to understand; the disadvantage is that there may be multiple IRRs.</li><li><strong>Payback Period:</strong> Calculates the time required to recover the initial investment. The advantage is its simplicity; the disadvantage is that it does not consider the time value of money or the overall profitability of the project.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company plans to invest in building a new factory with an initial investment of 10 million yuan and expects annual cash inflows of 3 million yuan for the next five years. Using the NPV method, assuming a discount rate of 10%, the project's net present value is positive, indicating that the project is worth investing in.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company considers purchasing new equipment with an initial investment of 2 million yuan and expects to save 500,000 yuan annually. Using the payback period method, the payback period is 4 years. If the company's target payback period is within 5 years, the project is feasible.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is the NPV method more commonly used than the payback period method?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Because the NPV method considers the time value of money and the overall profitability of the project, while the payback period method only focuses on the time to recover the initial investment.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the disadvantage of the IRR method?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The IRR method may have multiple IRRs, especially when there are multiple changes in cash flow, which can complicate decision-making.</li></ul></p>`} id={101245} />
