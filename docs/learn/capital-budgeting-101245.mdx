Capital budgeting is a process that businesses use to evaluate potential major projects or investments. Building a new plant or taking a large stake in an outside venture are examples of initiatives that typically require capital budgeting before they are approved or rejected by management.As part of capital budgeting, a company might assess a prospective project's lifetime cash inflows and outflows to determine whether the potential returns it would generate meet a sufficient target benchmark. The capital budgeting process is also known as investment appraisal.
