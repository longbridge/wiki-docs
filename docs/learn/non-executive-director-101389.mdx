The term non-executive director refers to a member of a company's board of directors. This board member isn't a company employee, which means they don't engage in the day-to-day management of the organization. Rather, most non-executive directors act as independent advisors and are involved in policymaking and planning exercises. Their responsibilities generally include monitoring executive directors and acting in the interest of corporate stakeholders.
