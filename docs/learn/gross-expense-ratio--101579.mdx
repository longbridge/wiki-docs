The gross expense ratio (GER) is the total percentage of a mutual fund's assets that are devoted to running the fund. The gross expense ratio includes any fee waiver or expense reimbursement agreements that may be in effect. However, it does not include any sales or brokerage commissions that are not charged to the fund directly but which would be included in the net expense ratio.Sometimes referred to as the audited gross expense ratio, data providers such as Morningstar pull the annual gross expense ratio from the fundâ€™s audited annual report. Annual-report expense ratios reflect the actual fees charged during a particular fiscal year, while prospectus expense ratios reflect material changes to the expense structure for the current period.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Total Expense Ratio (TER) is the percentage of a fund's total assets used for operating the fund. It includes management fees, operational fees, administrative fees, etc., but excludes sales fees or brokerage commissions. This ratio helps investors understand the operating costs of the fund.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the Total Expense Ratio originated in the mid-20th century as mutual funds became more popular and investors demanded greater transparency and cost control. Data providers like Morningstar extract the annual TER from the fund's audited annual reports for comparison and analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Total Expense Ratio can be divided into two categories:<ul><li><strong>Annual Report Expense Ratio:</strong> Reflects the actual fees charged during a specific fiscal year, providing a true picture of the fund's past operating costs.</li><li><strong>Prospectus Expense Ratio:</strong> Reflects substantial changes in the fee structure for the current period, helping investors understand potential future costs.</li></ul>Characteristics of the Total Expense Ratio include:<ul><li>High transparency: Provides a comprehensive view of the fund's operating costs.</li><li>Comparative strength: Investors can compare the TERs of different funds to choose the one with lower costs.</li><li>Excludes sales fees and brokerage commissions: These are included in the net expense ratio.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Fund A has a TER of 1.5%, meaning that for every $100 invested, $1.5 is used for operating expenses annually. If the fund's annual return is 8%, the net return after expenses is 6.5%.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Fund B has a TER of 0.75%, while Fund C has a TER of 2%. Investors can compare these TERs and choose the lower-cost Fund B to maximize net returns.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Does the TER include all fees?</strong> No, it does not. The TER excludes sales fees and brokerage commissions, which are included in the net expense ratio.</li><li><strong>How to use the TER to choose a fund?</strong> Investors can compare the TERs of different funds to select the one with lower operating costs, thereby increasing net returns.</li></ul></p>`} id={101579} />
