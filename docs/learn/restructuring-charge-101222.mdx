A restructuring charge is a one-time expense that a company pays when reorganizing its operations. Examples of one-time expenses include furloughing or laying off employees, closing manufacturing plants or shifting production to a new location. Companies undertake these moves in an effort to boost profitability, but first must take a one-off hit in the form of an upfront restructuring charge.
