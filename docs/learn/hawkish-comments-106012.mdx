Hawkish commentary refers to a relatively tight stance or viewpoint on monetary policy. Hawkish commentators typically believe that economic growth is strong and inflation pressures are rising, and measures should be taken to tighten the money supply to prevent inflation from worsening. Such commentary may have a significant impact on the market, especially with regard to monetary policy decisions and the foreign exchange market.
