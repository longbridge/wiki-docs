The gross processing margin (GPM) is the difference between the cost of a raw commodity and the income it generates once sold as a finished product. The gross processing margin is affected by supply and demand. The prices for raw commodities fluctuate, creating an ever-changing spread between the raw inputs and the processed products.Investors, traders, and speculators are able to trade futures based on the price difference between a raw commodity and the final product it produces. For example, a trader can go long on the commodity and short on the finished product of it.
