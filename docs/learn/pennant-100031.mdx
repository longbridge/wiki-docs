In technical analysis, a pennant is a type of continuation pattern formed when there is a large movement in a security, known as the flagpole, followed by a consolidation period with converging trend lines—the pennant—followed by a breakout movement in the same direction as the initial large movement, which represents the second half of the flagpole.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> In technical analysis, a flag is a continuation pattern. It occurs when a security experiences a sharp price movement (known as the flagpole), followed by a consolidation period marked by converging trend lines (the flag), and then a breakout in the same direction as the initial sharp movement, representing the second half of the flagpole.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the flag pattern originated in the early days of technical analysis. Analysts observed this specific price behavior pattern on market charts. Over time, the flag pattern has been widely applied in the technical analysis of stocks, forex, and futures markets.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The flag pattern mainly comes in two types: bullish flag and bearish flag. A bullish flag appears in an uptrend and usually indicates that the price will continue to rise; a bearish flag appears in a downtrend and usually indicates that the price will continue to fall. Characteristics of the flag pattern include: 1. Flagpole: Formed by a rapid and significant price movement. 2. Flag: Formed by a consolidation period where the price moves within a smaller range, usually showing parallel or converging trend lines. 3. Breakout: The price breaks out of the flag's consolidation range, continuing in the direction of the flagpole.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: On a daily chart of a stock, the price rapidly rises from $10 to $15 (flagpole), then consolidates between $14 and $15 (flag), and finally breaks out above $15, continuing to rise to $20. Case 2: In the forex market, a currency pair rapidly drops from 1.2000 to 1.1800 (flagpole), then consolidates between 1.1800 and 1.1850 (flag), and finally breaks below 1.1800, continuing to fall to 1.1600.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How to identify a flag pattern? A: A flag pattern typically consists of a flagpole, a flag, and a breakout. Observing these features on price charts can help identify a flag pattern. 2. How effective is the flag pattern? A: While the flag pattern is widely used in technical analysis, its effectiveness is not guaranteed. Investors should combine it with other technical indicators and market factors for comprehensive analysis.</p>`} id={100031} />
