Prepayment risk is the risk involved with the premature return of principal on a fixed-income security. When debtors return part of the principal early, they do not have to make interest payments on that part of the principal. That means investors in associated fixed-income securities will not receive interest paid on the principal. The prepayment risk is highest for fixed-income securities, such as callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Bonds with prepayment risk often have prepayment penalties.
