Line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points. Statisticians typically use the least squares method (sometimes known as ordinary least squares, or OLS) to arrive at the geometric equation for the line, either through manual calculations or by using software.A straight line will result from a simple linear regression analysis of two or more independent variables. A multiple regression involving several related variables can produce a curved line in some cases.
