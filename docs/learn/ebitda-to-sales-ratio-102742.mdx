The EBITDA-to-sales ratio, also known as EBITDA margin, is a financial metric used to assess a company's profitability by comparing its gross revenue with its earnings. More specifically, since EBITDA itself is derived in part from revenue, this metric indicates the percentage of a company's earnings remaining after operating expenses. A higher value indicates the company is able to produce earnings more efficiently by keeping costs low.
