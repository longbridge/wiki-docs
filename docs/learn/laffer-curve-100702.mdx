The Laffer Curve is based on a theory by supply-side economist Arthur Laffer. Created in 1974, it visually shows the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments.The curve is often used to illustrate the argument that cutting tax rates can result in increased total tax revenue.
