Cash surrender value is money a life insurance policyholder receives for canceling their policy before it matures or they pass away. This cash value is the savings component of most permanent lifeÂ insurance policies, such as whole life and universal life. It is also known as policyholder's equity. The insurance company could deduct a fee before paying out the cash value, known as a surrender charge.
