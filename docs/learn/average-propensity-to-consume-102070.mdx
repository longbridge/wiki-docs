Average propensity to consume (APC) measures the percentage of income that is spent rather than saved. This may be calculated by a single individual who wants to know where the money is going or by an economist who wants to track the spending and saving habits of an entire nation.In either case, the propensity to consume can be determined by dividing average household consumption, or spending, by average household income, or earnings.
