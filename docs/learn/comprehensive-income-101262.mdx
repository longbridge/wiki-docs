Comprehensive income is the variation in the value of a company's net assets from non-owner sources during a specific period. It includes net income and unrealized income. Unrealized income can be unrealized gains or losses on, for example, hedge/derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transaction gains or losses.Comprehensive income provides a complete view of a company's income, some of which may not be fully captured on the income statement.
