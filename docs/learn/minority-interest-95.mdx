Minority interest refers to the portion of net profit attributed to minority shareholders. In some companies, minority shareholders hold equity in the company but do not control its operations. Therefore, they only have a portion of the company's net profit, which is referred to as minority interest.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Minority interest refers to the equity interest in a subsidiary that is not owned by the parent company. These shareholders hold equity in the company but do not control its operations, thus they are entitled to a portion of the company's net profit, known as minority interest.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of minority interest originated from the need for consolidated financial statements. As corporate groups and multinational operations became more common, parent companies needed to reflect the full financial status of their subsidiaries in consolidated statements, and minority interest was used to distinguish the equity of the parent company from that of other shareholders.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Minority interest can be divided into two main categories: common stockholders' equity and preferred stockholders' equity. Common stockholders' equity typically includes voting rights and dividend rights, while preferred stockholders' equity has priority in dividends and liquidation but usually does not include voting rights. Characteristics of minority interest include: 1. Lack of control over company operations; 2. Entitlement to a portion of the company's net profit; 3. Right to a share of residual assets upon liquidation.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose Company A holds 80% of Company B's equity, and Company C holds 20%. In Company B's net profit, 80% belongs to Company A, and 20% belongs to Company C. This 20% is the minority interest. Case 2: Company D holds 70% of Company E's equity, and Company F holds 30%. In Company E's net profit, 70% belongs to Company D, and 30% belongs to Company F. This 30% is the minority interest.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does minority interest affect the parent company's financial statements? Answer: Minority interest is listed separately in consolidated statements and does not affect the parent company's net profit. 2. Do minority shareholders have the right to participate in company decisions? Answer: Minority shareholders typically do not control company operations but have voting rights at shareholders' meetings and can participate in major decisions.</p>`} id={95} />
