Minority interest refers to the portion of net profit attributed to minority shareholders. In some companies, minority shareholders hold equity in the company but do not control its operations. Therefore, they only have a portion of the company's net profit, which is referred to as minority interest.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Minority interest refers to the portion of a company's equity that is owned by shareholders who do not have controlling interest. These shareholders hold shares in the company but do not have control over its operations, and their interest is typically reflected in the company's financial statements as a separate item between liabilities and equity.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of minority interest developed with the increase in mergers and acquisitions. The earliest related regulations date back to the early 20th century, when laws began requiring companies to disclose minority interests in financial statements to protect the interests of small shareholders.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Minority interest can be categorized into two types: direct investment interest and indirect investment interest (such as through subsidiaries). The main feature of minority interest is that it does not grant the holder control over company decisions, but the holder is entitled to share in the company's profits and assets.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>A typical case is Alibaba Group. Alibaba lists minority interest in its financial statements, reflecting the equity of non-controlling shareholders in its subsidiaries. Another example is Tencent Holdings, which also discloses minority interest in its consolidated statements, showing the minority interests in its various subsidiaries.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often confuse minority interest with minority earnings. Minority interest refers to the shareholders' equity in the company's assets, while minority earnings refer to the portion of net income attributable to minority shareholders. Additionally, fluctuations in minority interest can affect a company's financial stability, which investors need to monitor.</p>`} id={95} />
