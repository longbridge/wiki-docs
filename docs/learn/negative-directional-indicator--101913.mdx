The Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) measures the presence of a downtrendÂ and is part of the Average Directional Index (ADX). If -DI is sloping upward, it's a sign that the price downtrend is getting stronger.This indicator is nearly always plotted along with the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI).

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>The Negative Directional Indicator (-DI) is a technical analysis tool used to measure the strength of a downward trend in the market. It is part of the Average Directional Index (ADX). Typically, -DI is used in conjunction with the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) to help investors determine the direction and strength of market trends. When -DI slopes upwards, it indicates that the downward trend in prices is strengthening.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The Negative Directional Indicator was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in 1978, detailed in his book 'New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.'
