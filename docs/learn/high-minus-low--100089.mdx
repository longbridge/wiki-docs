High Minus Low (HML), also referred to as the value premium, is one of three factors used in the Fama-French three-factor model. The Fama-French three-factor model is a system for evaluating stock returns that the economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French developed. HML accounts for the spread in returns between value stocks and growth stocks. This system argues that companies with high book-to-market ratios, also known as value stocks, outperform those with lower book-to-market values, known as growth stocks.
