<p>High Minus Low (HML) is one of three factors used in the Fama-French three-factor model. The Fama-French three-factor model is a system for evaluating stock returns that the economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French developed. HML accounts for the spread in returns between value stocks and growth stocks. This system argues that companies with high book-to-market ratios, also known as value stocks, outperform those with lower book-to-market values, known as growth stocks.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> High Minus Low (HML) is one of the three factors used in the Fama-French three-factor model. The Fama-French three-factor model, developed by economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, is a system for evaluating stock returns. HML explains the widening return differences between value stocks and growth stocks. The model posits that companies with high book-to-market ratios (i.e., value stocks) outperform those with lower book-to-market ratios (i.e., growth stocks).</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Fama-French three-factor model was introduced in 1992 by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French. The model was proposed to improve the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by adding two additional factors (i.e., size factor and value factor) to better explain variations in stock returns.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The HML factor is primarily used to distinguish between value stocks and growth stocks. Value stocks typically have high book-to-market ratios, exhibit lower price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, and are generally considered undervalued. Growth stocks, on the other hand, have lower book-to-market ratios, exhibit higher price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, and are generally considered to have high growth potential. The HML factor's characteristic is its ability to capture the return differences between value and growth stocks, thereby aiding investors in making more precise investment decisions.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. Suppose Investor A invested in a group of high book-to-market ratio companies (value stocks) in the early 1990s, while Investor B invested in a group of low book-to-market ratio companies (growth stocks). According to the Fama-French three-factor model, Investor A's investment returns might outperform Investor B's because value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks in the long run. 2. During the 2008 financial crisis, many growth stocks saw significant declines in market value, while value stocks remained relatively stable. At this time, the HML factor could help investors identify which stocks might perform better as the market recovers.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <em>Is the HML factor always effective?</em> While the HML factor performs well in the long term, it may be affected by market volatility in the short term. 2. <em>How is the HML factor calculated?</em> The HML factor is typically derived by calculating the return difference between high book-to-market ratio stocks and low book-to-market ratio stocks.</p>`} id={100089} />
