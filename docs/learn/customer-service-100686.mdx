Customer service is the direct one-on-one interaction between a consumer and a company representative. The interaction is commonly done when a consumer is buying a product or service from the company.Â Most retailers see this direct interaction as a critical factor in ensuring buyer satisfaction and encouraging repeat business. The option to speak to a live customer service agent is considered necessary for most businesses even though the bulk of customer care is automated. Customer service is also considered a key aspect of servant-leadership.
