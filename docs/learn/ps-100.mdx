Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) refers to the ratio between the market price of a stock and its per-share sales revenue. PSR is an indicator that measures the valuation of a company and can help investors evaluate its growth potential and investment value. A lower PSR may indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a higher PSR may indicate that a stock is overvalued. PSR can also be used to compare valuations between different companies or industries.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio) is the ratio of a company's stock market price to its per-share sales revenue. It is a valuation metric that helps investors assess a company's growth potential and investment value. A lower P/S ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a higher P/S ratio may suggest that the stock is overvalued. The P/S ratio can also be used to compare valuations across different companies or industries.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the P/S ratio emerged in the 1980s. Due to its simplicity and resistance to earnings volatility, it has been widely adopted by investors and analysts. Its popularity grew because of its effectiveness in evaluating startups and high-growth companies, especially when these companies have not yet achieved profitability.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The P/S ratio can be calculated in two main ways: based on per-share sales revenue and based on total sales revenue. The former is used for individual stock analysis, while the latter is used for overall company valuation. Key characteristics of the P/S ratio include:<ul><li>Simple and Understandable: Easy to calculate and apply.</li><li>Widely Applicable: Suitable for companies of different sizes and industries, especially those not yet profitable.</li><li>Relatively Stable: Not affected by short-term earnings volatility, better reflecting long-term company value.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>Case 1: Suppose Company A's stock price is $50, and its per-share sales revenue is $10, resulting in a P/S ratio of 50/10=5. If a peer company B has a P/S ratio of 3, this may indicate that Company A's stock is relatively overvalued.</li><li>Case 2: When evaluating a startup tech company that has not yet achieved profitability, the P/E ratio cannot be used. In this case, the P/S ratio becomes an important valuation tool. If the company's P/S ratio is 2, while the industry average is 4, this may suggest that the company is undervalued and has investment potential.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Is a lower P/S ratio always better?<br/>Not necessarily. While a lower P/S ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued, it could also reflect weak sales growth or market pessimism about the company's future prospects.</li><li>Can the P/S ratio be used alone for investment decisions?<br/>No. The P/S ratio should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics (such as the P/E ratio and P/B ratio) to comprehensively assess a company's investment value.</li></ul></p>`} id={100} />
