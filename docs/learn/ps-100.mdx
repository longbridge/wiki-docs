Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) refers to the ratio between the market price of a stock and its per-share sales revenue. PSR is an indicator that measures the valuation of a company and can help investors evaluate its growth potential and investment value. A lower PSR may indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a higher PSR may indicate that a stock is overvalued. PSR can also be used to compare valuations between different companies or industries.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio) is the ratio of a company's stock market price to its per-share sales revenue. It is a valuation metric that helps investors assess a company's growth potential and investment value. A lower P/S ratio may indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a higher P/S ratio may suggest it is overvalued.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of the P/S ratio originated in the late 20th century as investors sought diverse methods for company valuation. It offers a valuation approach that does not rely on earnings, making it particularly useful for companies that are not yet profitable but are experiencing rapid sales growth.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>The P/S ratio is primarily used to evaluate a company's relative value within different industries. Its features include simplicity and applicability to fast-growing sectors like technology and biotechnology. The advantage of the P/S ratio is that it is not affected by accounting policies, but its disadvantage is that it overlooks profitability.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>A typical case is Amazon in its early stages, where despite not being profitable, its high P/S ratio reflected market expectations of future growth. Another example is Tesla, which during its rapid expansion phase, had a P/S ratio above the industry average, indicating investor confidence in its growth potential.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face when using the P/S ratio include ignoring profitability and cash flow. A high P/S ratio does not always mean a company has good investment value; it may simply reflect market optimism about its future growth.</p>`} id={100} />
