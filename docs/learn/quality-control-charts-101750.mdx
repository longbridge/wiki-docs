A quality control chart is a graphic that depicts whether sampled products or processes are meeting their intended specifications. If not, the chart will show the degree by which they vary from specifications. A quality control chart that analyzes a specific attribute of a product is called a univariate chart, while a chart measuring variances in several product attributes is called a multivariate chart. Randomly selected products are tested for the given attribute(s) the chart is tracking.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Control Chart</h2><p><strong>Definition:</strong> A control chart is a graphical tool used to display whether sampled products or processes meet their expected specifications. If they do not meet the specifications, the chart will show the degree of deviation. Control charts help businesses monitor and improve product quality.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of control charts was first introduced by Walter A. Shewhart in the 1920s. While working at Bell Labs, he developed this chart to monitor quality fluctuations in manufacturing processes. Shewhart's work laid the foundation for modern Statistical Process Control (SPC).</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><ul><li><strong>Univariate Chart:</strong> Analyzes specific attributes of a product, such as size, weight, or color. Univariate charts are typically used to monitor a single quality characteristic.</li><li><strong>Multivariate Chart:</strong> Measures variations in multiple product attributes, such as monitoring both size and weight simultaneously. Multivariate charts provide a more comprehensive quality monitoring.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Application in Manufacturing:</strong> In the automotive manufacturing process, control charts can be used to monitor the dimensions of car body parts. If a batch of parts exceeds the specification range, the chart will show an anomaly, alerting engineers to make adjustments.</li><li><strong>Application in the Food Industry:</strong> In food production, control charts can be used to monitor product weight. For example, a food company regularly samples and checks the weight of cookies to ensure each cookie's weight is within the specified range. If a batch of cookies is found to be underweight or overweight, the chart will show an anomaly, allowing for timely adjustments to the production line.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>How to choose the right type of control chart?</strong> The choice of control chart type depends on the quality characteristics you want to monitor. Use a univariate chart for a single characteristic and a multivariate chart for multiple characteristics.</li><li><strong>How to interpret anomalies in control charts?</strong> Anomalies usually indicate some change or problem in the process. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which could be machine failure, raw material issues, or operator error.</li></ul></p>`} id={101750} />
