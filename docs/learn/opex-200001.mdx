<p>Operating Expenditure (Opex) refers to the ongoing costs incurred by a business in the regular course of its operations. These costs are necessary for the day-to-day functioning of the company and include expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, office supplies, marketing, and routine maintenance.</p><p>&nbsp;Unlike capital expenditures (Capex), which are investments in long-term assets that are expected to generate future benefits and are typically depreciated over time, Opex represents the recurring expenses that must be paid to keep the business running. Opex is often categorized as a recurring cost and is essential for the short-term operations of a company. It is a key component in financial planning and budgeting, and it helps businesses manage their cash flow and profitability.</p>
