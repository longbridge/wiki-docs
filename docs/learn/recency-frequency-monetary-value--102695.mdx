In particular, it evaluates customers’ (how long ago they made a purchase), (how often they make purchases), and  (how much money they spend).RFM is then used to identify a company’s or an organization’s best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits to improve low-scoring customers and maintain high-scoring ones.
