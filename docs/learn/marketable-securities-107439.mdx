Tradable securities refer to securities that can be transferred or sold at any time, such as stocks, bonds, and short-term bonds. Tradable securities usually have high liquidity, and investors can obtain cash or make other investments by selling these securities. The value of tradable securities usually fluctuates with changes in market supply and demand and market expectations.
