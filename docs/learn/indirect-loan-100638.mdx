An indirect loan can refer to an installment loan in which the lender – either the original issuer of the debt or the current holder of the debt – does not have a direct relationship with the borrower.Indirect loans can be obtained through a third party with the help of an intermediary. Loans trading in the secondary market may also be considered indirect loans.By allowing borrowers to obtain financing through third-party relationships, indirect loans can help to improve funding availability and risk management. Often applicants who don't qualify for a direct loan can opt for an indirect loan instead. Indirect loans tend to be more expensive – carry higher interest rates, that is – than direct loans are.
