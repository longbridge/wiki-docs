ADP employment data is an economic data indicator released by the American human resource management company Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), which is used to measure the changes in non-farm employment in the private sector in the United States. This data is usually released before the U.S. Department of Labor publishes the non-farm employment report at the beginning of each month, and is therefore considered an important indicator for predicting non-farm employment data.
