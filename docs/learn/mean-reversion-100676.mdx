The concept of mean reversion is widely used in various financial time series data, including price, earnings and book value. When an asset's current market price is less than its average past price, it's considered attractive for purchase. Conversely, if the current price is above the average, it's expected to fall. Traders and investors use mean reversion for timing of their respective trading and investment strategies.
