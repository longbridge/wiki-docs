<p>An ECN Broker, or Electronic Communication Network Broker, is a type of forex and financial markets broker that connects traders directly to liquidity providers (such as banks, financial institutions, and other traders) through an electronic communication network (ECN). ECN brokers do not take the opposite side of their clients' trades; instead, they match buy and sell orders through the ECN system, providing transparent, fast, and fair trading. This model typically offers tighter bid-ask spreads and deeper market liquidity. Traders with ECN brokers can see real-time market bid and ask quotes, benefiting from higher trade execution speed and lower slippage. Due to its transparency and efficiency, ECN brokers are highly popular among professional traders and institutional investors.</p>
