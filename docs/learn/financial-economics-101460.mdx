<p>Financial economics is a branch of&nbsp;economics&nbsp;that analyzes the use and distribution of resources in markets. Financial decisions must often take into account future events, whether those be related to individual&nbsp;stocks,&nbsp;portfolios,&nbsp;or the market as a whole.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Financial Economics</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Financial economics is a branch of economics that focuses on analyzing the use and distribution of resources in markets. It studies the behavior of financial markets, financial instruments, and financial institutions, aiming to understand and explain how financial decisions impact economic activities. Financial decisions often need to consider future events, whether related to individual stocks, investment portfolios, or the entire market.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The origins of financial economics can be traced back to the early 20th century when economists began systematically studying financial markets and instruments. In the 1970s, with the development of modern financial theories such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), financial economics gradually became an independent discipline.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Financial economics can be divided into the following main categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Corporate Finance:</strong> Studies how companies raise funds, invest, and distribute profits. It focuses on capital structure, dividend policy, and corporate governance.</li><li><strong>Investment:</strong> Studies how individuals and institutions select investment portfolios, focusing on asset pricing, risk management, and investment strategies.</li><li><strong>Financial Markets and Institutions:</strong> Studies the structure and function of financial markets and the role of financial institutions within these markets.</li></ul><p>Each category has its own characteristics and application scenarios. For example, corporate finance is mainly applied to internal corporate decisions, while investment focuses more on the investment behavior of individuals and institutions.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1: Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</strong><br/>CAPM is an important model in financial economics used to determine the expected return of an asset. It calculates the expected return based on the asset's systematic risk (beta). Suppose a stock has a beta of 1.2, the market's expected return is 8%, and the risk-free rate is 2%, then the expected return of the stock is:<br/>Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate)<br/>Expected Return = 2% + 1.2 * (8% - 2%) = 9.2%</p><p><strong>Case 2: Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)</strong><br/>EMH assumes that financial markets are efficient and all available information is already reflected in asset prices. Therefore, investors cannot achieve excess returns through technical analysis or fundamental analysis. Although this hypothesis is controversial, it holds a significant position in financial economics and influences the formulation of many investment strategies.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1: How does financial economics differ from traditional economics?</strong><br/>Financial economics focuses on the study of financial markets and instruments, while traditional economics more broadly studies the production, distribution, and consumption of resources.</p><p><strong>Question 2: What research methods are used in financial economics?</strong><br/>Common research methods in financial economics include mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and experimental economics.</p>`} id={101460} />
