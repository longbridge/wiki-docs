The term Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) refers to a government-owned corporation responsible for managing the sovereign wealth fund of Kuwait. Founded out of the Kuwait Investment Board in 1982, it was established to manage government revenue, derived primarily from the excess proceeds Kuwait earns from its oil reserves. The fund—the world's first and oldest—was created to lessen the country's dependence on oil.
