Underlying profit is a calculation made internally by a company to show what it believes is a more accurate reflection of how much money it generates. The number focuses on regular accounting cycleevents and often excludes one-time charges or infrequent occurrences. Underlying profit differs from the required accounting profit that is recorded on financial statements and other mandatory documents that follow preset practices, rules, and regulations.
