Guaranteed investment income is a type of investment product offered by insurance companies that allow clients to invest in equity, bond, and/or index fund while providing a promise of a predefined minimum value of the fund (usually, the initial investment amount) will be available at the fund's maturity or when the client dies.Insurance companies typically charge up to 1% of the investment amount per year for this service.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A capital-protected investment fund is an investment product offered by insurance companies, designed to provide investors with a certain level of principal protection. Investors can allocate their funds into a mix of stocks, bonds, or index funds, while the insurance company guarantees a predetermined minimum value at the fund's maturity or upon the investor's death, usually the initial investment amount. The insurance company typically charges an annual fee of 1% of the investment amount for this service.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of capital-protected investment funds originated in the late 20th century as market volatility increased, leading to a growing demand for safety and stability among investors. Insurance companies introduced these funds to cater to investors who sought to protect their principal while pursuing returns.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Capital-protected investment funds are mainly divided into two categories: fixed capital-protected funds and floating capital-protected funds.<ul><li><strong>Fixed Capital-Protected Funds:</strong> These funds guarantee the return of the initial investment amount at maturity, regardless of market performance. They are characterized by lower risk but also limited returns.</li><li><strong>Floating Capital-Protected Funds:</strong> These funds guarantee the return of a certain percentage of the initial investment amount (e.g., 90% or 95%) at maturity, while allowing investors to share in some of the market's upside. They are characterized by higher risk and potential returns compared to fixed capital-protected funds.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Mr. Zhang invested 100,000 yuan in a capital-protected investment fund offered by an insurance company in 2020, with a term of 5 years. The fund invests in a mix of stocks and bonds, and the insurance company guarantees to return at least 100,000 yuan in 2025. Even if the market performs poorly, Mr. Zhang will receive at least 100,000 yuan in 2025.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Ms. Li invested 200,000 yuan in a floating capital-protected fund from another insurance company in 2019, with a term of 3 years. The fund guarantees to return at least 95% of the initial investment amount in 2022, while also allowing Ms. Li to earn additional returns if the market performs well. Ultimately, Ms. Li received 190,000 yuan in principal and 20,000 yuan in investment returns in 2022.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Are capital-protected investment funds completely risk-free?</strong> While these funds offer principal protection, they are not entirely risk-free. Investors should consider the credit risk of the insurance company and the impact of management fees on the final returns.</li><li><strong>How are the returns of capital-protected investment funds calculated?</strong> The returns of these funds typically depend on the performance of the underlying assets and the management fees charged by the insurance company. Investors should carefully read the fund contract to understand the specific return calculation method.</li></ul></p>`} id={101793} />
