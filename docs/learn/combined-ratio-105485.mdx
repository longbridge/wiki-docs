Combined loss ratio is one of the indicators used by insurance companies to measure their core business. The combined loss ratio refers to the ratio of the costs incurred by an insurance company in paying claims and insurance expenses to its income. A combined loss ratio below 100% indicates that the insurance company's business is profitable, while a ratio above 100% means that the company's business is loss-making.
