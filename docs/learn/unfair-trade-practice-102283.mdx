<p>Unfair Trade Practices refer to activities in commercial transactions where businesses or individuals gain competitive advantages through unjust or fraudulent means. These practices may include deceptive advertising, false representation, price manipulation, dumping, patent infringement, abuse of market dominance, and more. Unfair trade practices not only harm the interests of other competitors but also undermine the environment of fair competition in the market, ultimately affecting consumer interests and the healthy development of the economy.
