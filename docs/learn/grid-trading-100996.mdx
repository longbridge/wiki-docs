Grid trading is when orders are placed above and below a set price, creating a grid of orders at incrementally increasing and decreasing prices. Grid trading is most commonly associated with the foreign exchange market. Overall the technique seeks to capitalize on normal price volatility in an asset by placing buy and sell orders at certain regular intervals above and below a predefined base price.For example, a forex trader could put buy orders every 15 pips above a set price, while also putting sell orders every 15 pips below that price. This takes advantages of trends. They could also place buy orders below a set price, and sell orders above. This takes advantages of ranging conditions.
