The OTCQX is the top tier of the three marketplaces for the over-the-counter (OTC) tradingÂ of stocks. The OTCQX is provided and operated by the OTC Markets Group. Stocks that trade on this forum must meet more stringent qualification criteria compared to the other tiers, which are the OTCQB/OTCBB and the Pink Sheets.
