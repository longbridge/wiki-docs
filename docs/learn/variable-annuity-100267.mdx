<p>A Variable Annuity (VA) is an insurance product that combines features of both investment and insurance. The policyholder pays premiums to the insurance company, which are then invested in a variety of investment options such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The value of these investments fluctuates based on market performance. The main characteristic of a variable annuity is that the returns and risks are borne by the policyholder, making the future payout amounts uncertain. Variable annuities typically offer death benefits and annuity payment options, providing a stream of income during retirement. The advantages of variable annuities include the potential for higher returns and tax-deferred growth, but they also come with higher fees and risks.</p>
