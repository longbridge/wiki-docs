A variable annuity is a type of annuity contract, the value of which can vary based on the performance of an underlying portfolio of sub accounts. Sub accounts and mutual funds are conceptually identical, but sub accounts donâ€™t have ticker symbols that investors can easily type into a fund tracker for research purposes.Among annuities, variable annuities differ from fixed annuities, which provide a specific and guaranteed return.
