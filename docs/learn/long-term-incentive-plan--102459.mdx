A long-term incentive plan (LTIP) is a company policy that rewards employees for reaching specific goals that lead to increased shareholder value.Â In a typical LTIP, the employee, usually an executive, must fulfill various conditions or requirements. In some forms of LTIPs, recipients receive special capped options in addition to stock awards.
