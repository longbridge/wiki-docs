A drag-along right is a provision or clause in an agreement that enables a majority shareholder to force a minority shareholder to join in the sale of a company. The majority owner doing the dragging must give the minority shareholder the same price, terms, and conditions as any other seller.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Drag-Along Rights are provisions or clauses in an agreement that allow majority shareholders to compel minority shareholders to participate in the sale of the company. The majority shareholders exercising the drag-along rights must offer the minority shareholders the same price, terms, and conditions as other sellers.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of drag-along rights originated in corporate law and shareholder agreements, aiming to protect the interests of majority shareholders and ensure smooth transactions during the sale of a company. The earliest drag-along rights clauses can be traced back to the mid-20th century, coinciding with the rise of private equity and venture capital.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Drag-along rights are typically divided into two categories: 1. Mandatory Drag-Along Rights: Minority shareholders must unconditionally participate when majority shareholders decide to sell the company. 2. Conditional Drag-Along Rights: Majority shareholders can exercise drag-along rights under specific conditions (e.g., reaching a certain equity threshold). Characteristics of drag-along rights include ensuring smooth transactions, protecting majority shareholders' interests, and reducing transaction resistance.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Majority shareholders of a tech company A decide to sell the company to a large tech enterprise B. According to the drag-along rights clause, minority shareholders must sell their shares at the same price and conditions. Case 2: Majority shareholders of a startup company C wish to sell the company to a venture capital firm D. Due to the drag-along rights clause, minority shareholders must also participate in the transaction, ensuring its smooth completion.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Can minority shareholders refuse drag-along rights? Generally, minority shareholders cannot refuse drag-along rights unless there are specific clauses in the agreement. 2. Do drag-along rights affect minority shareholders' interests? Drag-along rights require offering minority shareholders the same price and conditions as majority shareholders, typically not harming minority shareholders' interests.</p>`} id={100985} />
