<p>Dividend Declaration refers to the formal announcement by a company's board of directors that a dividend will be paid to shareholders. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders in the form of cash or additional shares.

This process signifies the transfer of a portion of the company's retained earnings to shareholders and is often seen as an indicator of the company's financial health and profitability.</p>
