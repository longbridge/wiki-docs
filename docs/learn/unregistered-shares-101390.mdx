Unregistered shares, also known as restricted stock, are securities that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are usually issued through private placements, Regulation D offerings, or employee stock benefit plans as compensation for professional services, or in exchange for funding a startup company.For example, a privately-held company might issue unregistered shares to its executives and board members as part of their compensation package.
