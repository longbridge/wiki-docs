<p>Unregistered Shares refer to shares of stock that have not been registered or listed with a stock exchange or regulatory authority. These shares are typically not eligible for trading on public markets because they have not undergone the required disclosure and regulatory processes. Unregistered shares may be issued in private placements, employee stock option plans, or other non-public offerings. Investors holding unregistered shares are often subject to transfer restrictions until the shares are registered or meet specific exemption criteria.</p>
