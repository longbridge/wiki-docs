The cost of equity is the return that a company requires to decide if an investment meets capital return requirements. Firms often use it as a capital budgeting threshold for the required rate of return. A firm’s cost of equity represents the compensation that the market demands in exchange for owning the asset and bearing the risk of ownership. The traditional formula for the cost of equity is the dividend capitalization model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cost of equity is the return a company requires to decide if an investment meets capital return requirements. It is often used as a threshold for capital budgeting. The cost of equity represents the compensation the market demands for owning the asset and bearing the ownership risk.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of cost of equity originated in the mid-20th century, evolving with the development of modern financial theory. Particularly, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) proposed by William Sharpe in 1964 provided a theoretical basis for calculating the cost of equity.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The cost of equity is primarily calculated using two methods: the Dividend Capitalization Model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).<br/>1. <strong>Dividend Capitalization Model:</strong> This model calculates the cost of equity based on the present value of future dividends, with the formula:<br/><code>Cost of Equity = (Expected Dividend Next Year / Current Stock Price) + Dividend Growth Rate</code>.<br/>2. <strong>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):</strong> This model considers systematic risk, with the formula:<br/><code>Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + β * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)</code>.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose a company’s current stock price is $100, the expected dividend next year is $5, and the dividend growth rate is 4%. According to the Dividend Capitalization Model, the cost of equity is:<br/><code>Cost of Equity = (5 / 100) + 0.04 = 0.09 or 9%</code>.<br/>2. <strong>Case 2:</strong> Suppose a company has a β of 1.2, a risk-free rate of 3%, and a market return of 8%. According to the CAPM model, the cost of equity is:<br/><code>Cost of Equity = 0.03 + 1.2 * (0.08 - 0.03) = 0.09 or 9%</code>.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>How to choose the appropriate model to calculate the cost of equity?</strong> The choice depends on the company's dividend policy and the availability of market data. If the company regularly pays dividends and the dividend growth is stable, the Dividend Capitalization Model is more suitable; otherwise, the CAPM model is more commonly used.<br/>2. <strong>Is the cost of equity fixed?</strong> The cost of equity can change with market conditions, the company's risk profile, and changes in the risk-free rate.</p>`} id={100855} />
