Subsequent public offering refers to the issuance of already listed shares by a listed company on the existing stock exchange market without increasing new shares. Subsequent public offering can be conducted to raise funds to support the company's expansion plans, debt repayment, or other purposes. In a subsequent public offering, existing shareholders can choose to purchase newly issued shares to maintain their proportion of equity in the company. The public can also become shareholders of the company by purchasing these newly issued shares. Subsequent public offerings usually need to comply with the listing regulations of the stock exchange and obtain approval from regulatory authorities.
