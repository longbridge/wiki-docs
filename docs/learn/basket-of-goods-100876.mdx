The consumer price indexÂ (CPI), a common measure of inflation, measures the price change over time for a basket of goods and services. The basket is representative of consumer spending patterns, and the change in its price represents the rate of inflation faced by consumers as a whole.For example, if the basket's price has increased 5% in the course of the year, consumer inflation can be said to be running at a 5% annual rate. The definition and contents of the measured basket can vary widely by country.In the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) monthly collects the prices of some 94,000 items from a scientifically selected sample of goods and services to assemble its representative basket. The numbers are then adjusted to ensure price changes don't reflect improvements in product quality, and weighted in proportion with consumer spending patterns derived from a separate survey of about 36,000 consumers in a given year.
