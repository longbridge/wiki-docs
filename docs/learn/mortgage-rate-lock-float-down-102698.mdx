The term mortgage rate lock float down refers to a financing option that locks in the interest rate on a mortgage with the option to reduce it if market rates fall during the lock period. A typical rate lock provides a borrower with security against an increase during the rate lock period. The float down option specifically allows the borrower to take advantage of a fall in interest rates during the lock period.
