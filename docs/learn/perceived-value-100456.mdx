<p>Perceived Value refers to the subjective evaluation of a product or service's worth by consumers, based on their personal feelings, perceptions, and expectations, rather than the actual market price or production cost of the product. Perceived value is influenced by various factors, including but not limited to product quality, brand reputation, user experience, marketing efforts, and social influence.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Perceived value refers to the subjective evaluation of a product or service by consumers, based on their personal feelings, perceptions, and expectations, rather than the actual market price or production cost of the product. Perceived value is influenced by various factors, including but not limited to product quality, brand reputation, user experience, market promotion, and social influence.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of perceived value can be traced back to early 20th-century marketing theories. As market competition intensified and consumer choices diversified, companies gradually realized that relying solely on product functionality and price was no longer sufficient to attract consumers. In the 1960s, the concept of perceived value further developed in marketing studies, becoming a crucial part of brand management and market positioning.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Perceived value can be divided into the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Functional Value:</strong> Based on the actual functionality and performance of the product or service.</li><li><strong>Emotional Value:</strong> Based on the emotional response of consumers to the product or service, such as pleasure or satisfaction.</li><li><strong>Social Value:</strong> Based on the status and reputation of the product or service in society.</li><li><strong>Economic Value:</strong> Based on the price and cost-effectiveness of the product or service.</li></ul>Each type of perceived value plays a different role in various consumption scenarios. For example, luxury goods from high-end brands rely more on emotional and social value, while everyday consumer goods focus more on functional and economic value.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Apple's iPhone. Although the production cost of an iPhone is not significantly higher than other smartphones, its perceived value is much higher than most competitors in the market. This is mainly due to Apple's success in brand building, user experience, and market promotion.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Starbucks coffee. Starbucks coffee is relatively expensive, but consumers are willing to pay a premium because they perceive not just the taste of the coffee, but also the brand culture, in-store atmosphere, and high-quality service.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is perceived value more important than actual value?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Because consumers' purchasing decisions are more based on their subjective feelings and perceptions rather than the actual cost or market price of the product.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How to enhance the perceived value of a product?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Perceived value can be enhanced by improving product quality, strengthening brand building, optimizing user experience, and effective market promotion.</li></ul></p>`} id={100456} />
