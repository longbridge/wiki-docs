Share buyback plan refers to the act of a listed company using its own funds to repurchase its issued shares.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Stock Buyback Plan</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A stock buyback plan refers to the action where a listed company uses its own funds to repurchase its issued shares. By repurchasing its shares, a company can increase earnings per share (EPS), stabilize the stock price, improve financial conditions, and enhance shareholder value. Stock buyback plans are usually undertaken when a company believes its stock is undervalued.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of stock buyback plans originated in the early 20th century but became widely used in the late 1980s. In 1982, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Rule 10b-18, which clarified the conditions and procedures under which companies could legally repurchase their shares. This rule significantly promoted the popularity of stock buybacks.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Stock buyback plans are mainly divided into two categories: open market repurchases and tender offers. Open market repurchases involve the company buying its shares on the open market, offering high flexibility and lower costs. Tender offers involve the company making an offer to shareholders to repurchase a certain number of shares at a fixed price, typically used for large-scale buybacks, with transparent pricing but higher costs.</p><p>The main characteristics of stock buybacks include: 1. Increasing EPS: By reducing the number of outstanding shares, EPS increases accordingly. 2. Stabilizing stock price: Buybacks can provide support during market volatility, stabilizing the stock price. 3. Improving financial conditions: Through buybacks, companies can optimize their capital structure, reduce equity, and enhance shareholder returns.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Apple Inc. launched a large-scale stock buyback plan in 2012, repurchasing over $200 billion worth of shares. This move not only increased EPS but also boosted investor confidence, driving a continuous rise in the stock price.</p><p>Case 2: Microsoft Corp. announced a $40 billion stock buyback plan in 2013. Through this plan, Microsoft successfully increased EPS and stabilized its stock price to some extent, enhancing market confidence in the company.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why do companies conduct stock buybacks? Companies usually conduct stock buybacks because management believes the company's stock is undervalued. Buybacks can increase EPS, stabilize the stock price, and enhance shareholder value.</p><p>2. How do stock buybacks affect shareholders? Stock buybacks can increase EPS and enhance the value of shareholders' holdings, but they may also reduce the company's cash flow, affecting future investments and development.</p>`} id={106092} />
