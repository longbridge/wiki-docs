A cash dividend is the distribution of funds or money paid to stockholders generally as part of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits.Cash dividends are paid directly in money, as opposed to being paid as a stock dividend or other form of value. Most brokers offer a choice to reinvest or accept cash dividends.
