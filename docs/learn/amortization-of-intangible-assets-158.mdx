Amortization of intangible assets refers to the process by which a company allocates the expense of intangible assets over their useful life according to a certain method. Intangible assets refer to intangible rights used for the production of goods, rendering of services, leasing or operation, such as patent rights, trademark rights, copyrights, etc. The amortization of intangible assets is to reflect the expenses generated by the use of intangible assets each year and to carry out corresponding accounting treatments.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Amortization of Intangible Assets</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Amortization of intangible assets refers to the process by which a company allocates the cost of intangible assets over their useful life. Intangible assets are non-physical rights used in the production of goods, provision of services, leasing, or business operations, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The purpose of amortization is to reflect the annual expense incurred from using these intangible assets and to perform the corresponding accounting treatment.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of amortization of intangible assets originated from the development of accounting, particularly in the early 20th century, as companies began to place more importance on intangible assets. Key events include the standardization efforts by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Amortization of intangible assets mainly includes the straight-line method and the accelerated amortization method:</p><ul><li><strong>Straight-line method:</strong> The same amount is amortized each year, suitable for intangible assets with a stable useful life.</li><li><strong>Accelerated amortization method:</strong> Higher amounts are amortized in the early years, decreasing over time, suitable for intangible assets with higher early returns.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company purchases a patent for 1 million yuan with a useful life of 10 years. The company uses the straight-line method for amortization, with an annual amortization amount of 100,000 yuan. Thus, the company records 100,000 yuan as an expense in its financial statements each year, reflected in the income statement.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company purchases a trademark for 2 million yuan, expecting higher returns in the first 5 years and lower returns in the last 5 years. The company uses the accelerated amortization method, with an annual amortization amount of 300,000 yuan for the first 5 years and 100,000 yuan for the last 5 years. Thus, the company records 300,000 yuan as an expense in its financial statements each year for the first 5 years and 100,000 yuan each year for the last 5 years.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between amortization of intangible assets and depreciation?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Amortization of intangible assets is the allocation of costs for intangible assets, while depreciation is the allocation of costs for tangible assets (such as equipment and buildings). The accounting treatment is similar, but they apply to different types of assets.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Does amortization of intangible assets affect a company's taxes?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, amortization of intangible assets affects a company's taxes because the amortization expense can be deducted before tax, thereby reducing the company's taxable income.</p>`} id={158} />
