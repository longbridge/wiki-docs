Non-GAAP EPS (Earnings Per Share) is a measure of a company's operating performance, which excludes the impact of certain non-recurring items on the company's profitability. Typically, non-GAAP EPS excludes special items, non-recurring gains or losses, and acquisition-related expenses, among others. This allows for a more accurate reflection of the company's core profitability.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Non-GAAP EPS</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Non-GAAP EPS (Earnings Per Share) is a measure of a company's operating performance that excludes certain non-recurring items affecting profitability, such as special items, non-recurring gains and losses, and merger-related expenses. This provides a more accurate reflection of the company's core profitability.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of Non-GAAP EPS originated from the need for more transparent financial reporting. As business operations became more complex, traditional GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) sometimes failed to fully capture a company's actual performance. Therefore, companies began using non-GAAP metrics to provide a clearer picture of their financial health.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Non-GAAP EPS mainly includes the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Adjusted EPS:</strong> Excludes one-time expenses and revenues, such as restructuring costs and asset impairment losses.</li><li><strong>Continuing Operations EPS:</strong> Considers only the earnings from the company's ongoing operations, excluding sold or discontinued segments.</li></ul><p>The common characteristic of these categories is that they exclude non-recurring items to better reflect the company's core profitability.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A tech company reports its GAAP EPS as $1.50, but due to a one-time restructuring cost of $0.30, the company excludes this cost in its Non-GAAP EPS, resulting in an adjusted Non-GAAP EPS of $1.80. This allows investors to see the company's core profitability more clearly.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A retail company reports its GAAP EPS as $2.00, but due to a one-time gain of $0.50 from selling a part of its business, the company excludes this gain in its Non-GAAP EPS, resulting in an adjusted Non-GAAP EPS of $1.50. This helps investors more accurately assess the company's ongoing operational performance.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: Why use Non-GAAP EPS?</strong><br/>A1: Non-GAAP EPS can exclude non-recurring items, making the EPS more reflective of the company's core profitability.</p><p><strong>Q2: Is Non-GAAP EPS more accurate than GAAP EPS?</strong><br/>A2: Non-GAAP EPS is not necessarily more accurate, but it provides a different perspective, helping investors gain a more comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health.</p>`} id={104679} />
