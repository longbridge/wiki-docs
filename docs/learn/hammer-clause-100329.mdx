<p>The Hammer Clause, commonly found in liability insurance policies, particularly in professional liability (such as for lawyers, doctors, etc.) and directors and officers (D&amp;O) insurance, stipulates that if the insured refuses to accept a settlement offer proposed by the insurer and chooses to continue litigation, the insurer will limit its liability. Specifically, if the final judgment exceeds the amount of the proposed settlement, the insured must cover the excess amount. The purpose of this clause is to encourage the insured to accept reasonable settlement offers, thereby avoiding costly litigation and the risk of higher losses.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The hammer clause is typically found in liability insurance contracts, especially in professional liability insurance (such as for lawyers, doctors, and other professionals) and directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance. This clause stipulates that if the insured refuses to accept a settlement offer proposed by the insurance company and chooses to continue litigation, the insurance company will limit its compensation amount. Specifically, if the final litigation result is higher than the settlement amount initially suggested by the insurance company, the insured must bear the excess amount themselves. The purpose of this clause is to encourage the insured to accept reasonable settlement offers, thereby avoiding high litigation costs and potential greater losses.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The origin of the hammer clause can be traced back to the mid-20th century when insurance companies began to realize that high litigation costs and uncertain litigation outcomes posed a threat to their financial stability. To mitigate these risks, insurance companies introduced the hammer clause to encourage the insured to accept settlement offers, thereby reducing litigation costs and potential compensation amounts.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>The hammer clause mainly falls into two categories: hard hammer clauses and soft hammer clauses. Hard hammer clauses strictly require the insured to accept the insurance company's settlement offer, or else they must bear the excess costs themselves. Soft hammer clauses are relatively lenient, allowing the insured to refuse the settlement offer within a certain range but still requiring them to bear part of the excess costs. The advantage of hard hammer clauses is that they can more effectively control litigation costs, but they may cause dissatisfaction among the insured; soft hammer clauses, on the other hand, balance the interests of both the insurance company and the insured to some extent.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p>Case 1: A lawyer at a law firm was sued for professional negligence. The insurance company suggested a settlement of $500,000, but the lawyer believed they were not at fault and chose to continue litigation. The court eventually awarded $800,000 in damages. According to the hammer clause, the lawyer had to bear the excess $300,000 themselves.</p><p>Case 2: A doctor at a medical institution was sued for medical malpractice. The insurance company suggested a settlement of $1,000,000, but the doctor believed the settlement amount was too high and chose to continue litigation. The court eventually awarded $1,500,000 in damages. According to the hammer clause, the doctor had to bear the excess $500,000 themselves.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p>1. Does the hammer clause apply to all types of liability insurance?<br/>Answer: The hammer clause mainly applies to professional liability insurance and directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance. It is less common in other types of liability insurance.</p><p>2. Can the insured negotiate to modify the hammer clause with the insurance company?<br/>Answer: In some cases, the insured can negotiate to modify the hammer clause with the insurance company, but this usually needs to be done before signing the insurance contract.</p>`} id={100329} />
