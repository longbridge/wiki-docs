In finance, the term "holdovers" refers to transactions—usually checks—that have not yet been processed. In most cases today, the period of time in which checks are held as holdovers typically does not exceed one business day.A holdover may also refer to a tenant who remains in a property after the expiration of the lease and is subject to eviction.
