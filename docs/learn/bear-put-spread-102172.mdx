A bear put spread is a type of options strategy where an investor or trader expects a moderate-to-large decline in the price of a security or asset and wants to reduce the cost of holding the option trade. A bear put spread is achieved by purchasing put options while also selling the same number of puts on the same asset with the same expiration date at a lower strike price. The maximum profit using this strategy is equal to the difference between the two strike prices, minus the net cost of the options.A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of underlying security at a specified strike price, at or before the option expires.A bear put spread is also known as a debit put spread or a long put spread.
