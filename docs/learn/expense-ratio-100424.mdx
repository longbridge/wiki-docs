The expense ratio measures how much of a fund's assets are used for administrative and other operating expenses. For investors, the expense ratio is deducted from the fund's gross return and paid to the fund manager.An expense ratio is determined by dividing a fund's operating expenses by the average dollar value of its assets under management (AUM). Operating expenses reduce the fund's assets, thereby reducing the return to investors.
