A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate.Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investmentsâ€”without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.
