<p>A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company or trust that owns, operates, and manages income-producing real estate assets to generate returns for investors. REITs allow individual investors to invest in large-scale, income-generating real estate projects by purchasing publicly traded shares, without the need to directly buy and manage the properties. REITs typically hold various types of real estate, including commercial properties (such as office buildings and shopping centers), residential properties, industrial properties, and hotels. By distributing rental income and capital appreciation to shareholders, REITs provide a relatively stable income source and potential capital growth. Additionally, REITs often enjoy tax advantages, as they distribute most of their income to shareholders, thereby reducing corporate income tax.</p>
