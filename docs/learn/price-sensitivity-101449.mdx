<p>Price sensitivity refers to the degree to which the quantity demanded of a good or service responds to changes in its price. High price sensitivity means that even a small change in price will lead to a significant change in demand, while low price sensitivity indicates that price changes have little effect on demand. Price sensitivity is typically measured by the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED), given by the formula:</p><p>Price&nbsp;Elasticity&nbsp;of&nbsp;Demand=Percentage&nbsp;Change&nbsp;in&nbsp;Quantity&nbsp;Demanded/Percentage&nbsp;Change&nbsp;in</p><p>When the price elasticity coefficient is greater than 1, the demand is considered elastic; when it is less than 1, the demand is considered inelastic.</p>
