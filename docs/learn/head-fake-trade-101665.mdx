A head-fake trade occurs when a security's price moves in one direction, but then reverses course and moves in the opposite direction. The head-fake trade gets its name from a tactic used by a basketball or football player to confuse the opposition, leading with their head to pretend that they are moving in one direction but then moving in the other way. The head-fake trade occurs most often at key breakout points, such as major support or resistance levels, or with moving averages like the 50-day or 200-day simple moving average (SMA).
