DDP is the opposite of DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid).</p><h2>Definition</h2><p>Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) is an international trade term indicating that the seller is responsible for delivering goods to the buyer's specified location and bears all related costs and risks, including transportation fees, export and import duties, insurance, and other related expenses.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of DDP originated from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Incoterms, first introduced in 1936. As global trade developed, DDP became a common trade term, helping buyers and sellers clearly define their responsibilities and cost-sharing.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>The main characteristic of DDP is that the seller assumes almost all responsibilities and costs, making the purchasing process simpler for the buyer. Compared to other trade terms (such as FOB, CIF), the seller's responsibility and costs are higher in DDP. DDP is suitable when the seller can handle import procedures and pay related fees.</p><h2>Comparison with Similar Concepts</h2><p>DDP is the opposite of DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid).

The manufacturer is responsible for delivering the products to the US retailer's warehouse and paying all transportation fees, insurance, export, and import duties. The retailer only needs to receive the goods at the warehouse without handling any import procedures.</p><p>Case 2: A German auto parts supplier signs a DDP agreement with a French car manufacturer. The supplier is responsible for delivering the parts to the French manufacturer's factory and paying all related costs.
