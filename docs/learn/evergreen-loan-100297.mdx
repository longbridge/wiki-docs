<p>An Evergreen Loan, also known as a Revolving Loan or Perpetual Loan, is a type of loan that does not have a fixed maturity date, allowing the borrower to continuously borrow and repay funds up to a certain limit. This loan functions similarly to a revolving line of credit, where the borrower can draw funds as needed and repay them, making the funds available for borrowing again. Evergreen loans are often used by businesses that require ongoing access to capital for managing operating cash flow or short-term financing needs. Although there is no fixed maturity date, evergreen loans typically undergo periodic reviews and renewals to assess the borrower's creditworthiness and repayment capability.</p>
