An evergreen loan is a loan that does not require the repayment of principal during the life of the loan, or during a specified period of time. In an evergreen loan, the borrower is required to make only interest payments during the life of the loan. Evergreen loans are usually in the form of a line of credit that is continuously paid down, leaving the borrower with available funds for credit purchases. Evergreen loans may also be known as “standing” or “revolving” loans.
