The Merton model is a mathematical formula that stock analysts and commercial loan officers, among others, can use to judge a corporationâ€™s risk of credit default. Named for economist Robert C. Merton, who proposed it in 1974, the Merton model assesses the structural credit risk of a company by modeling its equity as a call option on its assets.
