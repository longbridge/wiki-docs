The reserve ratio is the portion of reservable liabilities that commercial banks must hold onto, rather than lend out or invest. This is a requirement determined by the country's central bank, which in the United States is the Federal Reserve. It is also known as the cash reserve ratio.The minimum amount of reserves that a bank must hold on to is referred to as the reserve requirement, and is sometimes used synonymously with the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is specified by the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s Regulation D. Regulation D created a set of uniform reserve requirements for all depository institutions with transaction accounts, and requires banks to provide regular reports to the Federal Reserve.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The reserve ratio refers to the portion of depositors' balances that commercial banks must have on hand as cash. This requirement is set by the country's central bank and is also known as the cash reserve ratio. The minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold is called the reserve requirement, and it is sometimes used interchangeably with the reserve ratio.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the reserve ratio originated in the 19th century during the development of the banking industry.
