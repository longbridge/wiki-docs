A degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a companyâ€™s earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure. The degree of financial leverage (DFL) measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in operating income, also known as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).This ratio indicates that the higher the degree of financial leverage, the more volatile earnings will be. Since interest is usually a fixed expense, leverage magnifies returns and EPS. This is good when operating income is rising, but it can be a problem when operating income is under pressure.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Financial leverage refers to the leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company's earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income. This is caused by changes in the capital structure. Financial leverage measures the percentage change in EPS when operating income (also known as earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT) changes by one unit. The higher the financial leverage, the greater the volatility in earnings. Since interest is usually a fixed cost, leverage amplifies returns and EPS. This is beneficial when operating income rises, but it can be problematic when operating income is under pressure.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of financial leverage originated in the early 20th century and evolved with the increasing complexity of modern corporate financing structures. Early research focused on how debt financing could enhance shareholder returns, but over time, researchers found that high leverage also brings greater financial risk.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Financial leverage can be categorized into high leverage and low leverage. High leverage companies typically rely heavily on debt financing, which allows them to achieve higher EPS when operating income rises but also increases risk when operating income falls. Low leverage companies are more conservative, relying more on equity financing, which results in lower returns but also lower risk.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company increases its financial leverage by issuing bonds. When the company's operating income increases by 10%, its EPS increases by 20%, demonstrating the amplifying effect of high leverage. Case 2: Another company opts for equity financing by issuing new shares, maintaining low leverage. When its operating income increases by 10%, its EPS only increases by 5%, but the decline in EPS is also smaller when operating income falls.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why does high financial leverage increase risk? High leverage means the company has to pay fixed interest costs, and when operating income falls, these fixed costs can lead to a significant drop in EPS. 2. How to determine if a company's financial leverage is appropriate? This can be assessed by comparing the leverage levels of peer companies and the company's historical performance.</p>`} id={101312} />
