Perpetual bond refers to a type of debt security with no fixed maturity date, also known as a perpetual bond. Unlike traditional bonds, perpetual bonds have no maturity date, and therefore, have no obligation to repay the principal. The issuer of perpetual bonds can choose whether to repay the principal under certain conditions or not repay it and continue to pay interest. Perpetual bonds typically have higher interest rates to compensate investors for the risk involved.
