<p>A Leveraged Buyback, or Leveraged Share Repurchase, is a corporate financial strategy where a company uses borrowed funds to repurchase its own shares. The company raises funds by issuing debt (such as bonds or loans) and then uses these funds to buy back its outstanding shares in the market. The goal of a leveraged buyback is to reduce the number of shares outstanding, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS) and shareholder returns.</p>
