Allocational efficiency, also known as allocative efficiency, is a characteristic of an efficient market where the optimal distribution of goods in an economy meets the needs and wants of society. The goal of allocative efficiency is to ensure that resources are used so that their marginal benefit to society is equal to their marginal cost.
