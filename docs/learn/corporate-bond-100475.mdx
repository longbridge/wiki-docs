<p>A corporate bond is a debt security issued by a corporation to raise funds from investors. The corporation borrows money from investors by issuing bonds and promises to repay the principal amount on a specified future date, along with periodic interest payments in the interim. Corporate bonds are typically used to finance expansion, research and development, or other capital-intensive projects. The interest rates on corporate bonds are generally higher than those on government bonds due to the higher risk associated with corporate debt.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by companies. By issuing bonds, companies borrow money from investors and promise to repay the principal at a future date while making regular interest payments in the meantime. Corporate bonds are typically used to raise funds for expansion, research and development, or other capital-intensive projects. The interest rates on corporate bonds are usually higher because they carry more risk compared to government bonds.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The history of corporate bonds dates back to the 19th century when the Industrial Revolution spurred a significant demand for capital by companies. The earliest corporate bond issuances can be traced to railroad companies, which needed substantial funds to build railway networks. Over time, more companies began to issue bonds to raise capital.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Corporate bonds can be classified based on different criteria. By credit rating, there are investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds (junk bonds); by maturity, there are short-term, medium-term, and long-term bonds. Investment-grade bonds have lower risk and lower interest rates, while high-yield bonds have higher risk and higher interest rates. Short-term bonds typically have maturities of 1-3 years, medium-term bonds 3-10 years, and long-term bonds over 10 years.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> 1. In 2013, Apple Inc. issued $17 billion in corporate bonds, one of the largest corporate bond issuances at the time. Apple used the funds for stock buybacks and dividend payments. 2. In 2020, Tesla Inc. issued $2 billion in convertible bonds, which can be converted into company stock under certain conditions, helping Tesla raise funds for expanding production lines and developing new technologies.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What are the main risks of investing in corporate bonds? The main risks include credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. 2. How do corporate bonds differ from government bonds? Corporate bonds typically have higher risk and interest rates compared to government bonds because companies have higher credit risk than governments.</p>`} id={100475} />
