A high-yield investment program (HYIP) is a fraudulent investment scheme that purports to deliver extraordinarily high returns on an investment.HYIPs often advertise yields of more than 100% per year in order to tempt investors. They regularly use new investors' money to pay off long-standing investors. Monies received in such schemes aren't actually invested.HYIPs should not be confused with a legitimate high-yield bond investment, which offers higher than investment-grade bond interest rates.
