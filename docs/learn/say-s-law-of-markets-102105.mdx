Say's Law of Markets comes from chapter XV, "Of the Demand or Market for Products" of French economist Jean-Baptiste Say's 1803 book, . It is a classical economic theory that says that the income generated by past production and sale of goods is the source of spending that creates demand to purchase current production. Modern economists have developed varying views and alternative versions of Say's Law.
