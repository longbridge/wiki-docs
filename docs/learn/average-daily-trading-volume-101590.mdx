Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors.Many traders and investors prefer higher average daily trading volume over low trading volume, because with high volume it is easier to get into and out of positions. Low-volume assets have fewer buyers and sellers, and therefore it may be harder to enter or exit at a desired price.
