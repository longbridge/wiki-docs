A proxy statement is a document containing the information the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires companies to provide to shareholders so they can make informed decisions about matters that will be brought up at an annual or special stockholder meeting. Issues covered in a proxy statement can include proposals for new additions to the board of directors, information on directors' salaries, information on bonus and options plans for directors, and any declarations made by the company's management.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A proxy statement is a document containing information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that companies must provide to shareholders to enable them to make informed decisions on matters to be presented at annual or special shareholder meetings. The proxy statement covers issues such as proposals for new board members, information on director compensation, details of director bonuses and option plans, and any statements made by the company's management.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The origin of the proxy statement can be traced back to the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which required companies to provide detailed information to shareholders before shareholder meetings to ensure transparency and shareholder awareness. Over time, the SEC has continuously updated and refined the regulations to adapt to market changes and investor needs.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Proxy statements are mainly divided into two categories: annual proxy statements and special proxy statements. Annual proxy statements are typically issued before the annual shareholder meeting and cover information such as the company's annual performance, board member nominations, and compensation plans. Special proxy statements are issued before special shareholder meetings and usually involve specific matters such as major mergers or asset restructurings. The characteristics of proxy statements include detailed information, high transparency, and a wide range of coverage, aiming to help shareholders make informed decisions.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1.

Another company issues a special proxy statement before planning a major merger, explaining the reasons for the merger, expected benefits, and potential risks in detail. By reading this report, shareholders can assess the impact of the merger on the company's future development and vote at the special shareholder meeting.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is it mandatory to issue a proxy statement? Yes, according to SEC regulations, publicly traded companies must issue a proxy statement before shareholder meetings. 2.
