Overbought is a term used when a security is believed to be trading at a level above its intrinsic or fair value. Overbought generally describes recent or short-term movement in the price of the security, and reflects an expectation that the market will correct the price in the near future. This belief is often the result of technical analysis of the securityâ€™s price history, but fundamentals may also be employed. A stock that is overbought may be a good candidate for sale.The opposite of overbought is oversold, where a security is thought to be trading below its intrinsic value.
