An underwriting group is a temporary association of investment bankers and broker-dealers who wish to purchase a new issue of securities from an issuer in order to distribute the issue to investors at a profit. The underwriting group shares the risk and aids in the successful distribution of the new securities issue once the issuance goes public.Â An underwriting group is also called a purchase group, a distributing syndicate, or a syndicate.
