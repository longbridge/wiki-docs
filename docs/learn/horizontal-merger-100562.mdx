A horizontal merger is a merger or business consolidation that occurs between firms that operate in the same industry. Competition tends to be higher among companies operating in the same space, meaningÂ synergies and potential gains in market share are much greater for merging firms.This type of merger occurs frequently because of larger companies attempting to create more efficient economies of scale. Conversely, a vertical merger takes place when firms from different parts of the supply chain consolidate to make the production process more efficient or cost-effective.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Horizontal Merger</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>A horizontal merger refers to the merger or business integration between companies operating in the same industry. This type of merger typically occurs in highly competitive markets with the aim of achieving higher economic efficiency through synergies and increased market share.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of horizontal mergers originated in the early 20th century when many companies merged to expand their market share and reduce costs. With the intensification of globalization and market competition, horizontal mergers became more common in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Horizontal mergers can be divided into two main types: complete mergers and partial mergers. A complete merger involves the full integration of two companies into a new entity, while a partial merger involves the integration of certain business areas while maintaining the independence of each company. The main characteristics of horizontal mergers include:</p><ul><li>Economies of scale: Companies can reduce production and operational costs through mergers.</li><li>Market share: The merged company usually occupies a larger market share.</li><li>Synergies: Companies can achieve higher efficiency and effectiveness through resource sharing and business integration.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: In 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) merged with SABMiller, becoming the world's largest beer company. This merger allowed the new company to occupy a larger share of the global beer market and reduce production costs through economies of scale.</p><p>Case 2: In 2019, Disney acquired major assets of 21st Century Fox. This merger allowed Disney to occupy a larger market share in the entertainment and media industry and achieve synergies through content integration and resource sharing.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Are horizontal mergers always successful?<br/>Not necessarily. While horizontal mergers have many potential benefits, they also carry risks such as integration failure, cultural conflicts, and regulatory hurdles.</p><p>2. What is the difference between horizontal and vertical mergers?<br/>A horizontal merger refers to the merger between companies in the same industry, while a vertical merger refers to the merger between companies in different parts of the supply chain.</p>`} id={100562} />
