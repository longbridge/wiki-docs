<p>Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) refers to the total value of merchandise sold through an e-commerce platform over a specific period. It includes the total amount of all completed transactions without deducting returns, cancellations, or other fees. GMV is an important metric for assessing the business scale and market performance of an e-commerce platform, but it does not directly reflect the platform's net income or profitability.</p><p>GMV = Sales + Cancelled Order Amount + Rejected Order Amount + Returned Order Amount.</p><p>GMV is not actual transaction data, but can be used for reference purposes. As long as the customer takes a purchase action, it will be counted in GMV whether the purchase is actually made or not. It can be used to research customer purchase intent. E-commerce platforms like JD.com and Taobao generally use GMV, which has better timeliness than other metrics.</p>
