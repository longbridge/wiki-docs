Post-trade processing occurs after a trade is complete. At this point, the buyer and the seller compare trade details, approve the transaction, change records of ownership, and arrange for the transfer of securities and cash. Post-trade processing is especially important in markets that are not standardized, such as the over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
