A white knight is a hostile takeover defense whereby a 'friendly' individual or company acquires a corporation at fair consideration when it is on the verge of being taken over by an 'unfriendly' bidder or acquirer. The unfriendly bidder is generally known as the "black knight."Although the target company does not remain independent, acquisition by a white knight is still preferred to the hostile takeover. Unlike a hostile takeover, current management typically remains in place in a white knight scenario, and investors receive better compensation for their shares.
