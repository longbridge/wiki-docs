Other operating costs refer to the costs incurred by a company during its operation, excluding sales costs, administrative expenses, and financial expenses. These costs are usually non-core business-related costs, such as administrative expenses, legal service fees, advertising and promotional expenses, etc.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other operating costs refer to expenses incurred by a company during its operations that are not included in sales costs, administrative expenses, or financial expenses. These costs are typically related to non-core business activities, such as administrative fees, legal service fees, advertising expenses, etc.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of other operating costs has evolved with the development of corporate management and accounting systems. As business operations become more diverse and complex, traditional cost classifications cannot cover all expenditure items, necessitating a broader category to record and manage these non-core business-related costs.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other operating costs can be categorized into various types, including but not limited to administrative fees, legal service fees, advertising expenses, and research and development costs. The common feature of these costs is that they are not directly related to the core production or sales activities of the company but play a crucial supporting role in the overall operation and strategic development of the business. Application scenarios include daily operations, marketing activities, and legal compliance management.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A technology company listed significant R&D expenses in its annual financial report, classified as other operating costs because they are not directly related to product sales but are vital for the company's innovation and long-term growth. Case 2: A large retail company invested heavily in advertising expenses to expand its market share, which were also classified as other operating costs because they supported the company's market strategy.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand the importance of other operating costs, considering them unnecessary or reducible. However, neglecting these costs can lead to a loss of competitive advantage in the market. Additionally, accurately classifying and managing these costs is a challenge faced by companies.</p>`} id={43} />
