Compensatory damages are money awarded to an injured party that compensate for damages, injury, or another incurred loss. Compensatory damages are awarded in civil court cases where loss has occurred as a result of the negligence or unlawful conduct of another party.To receive compensatory damages, the plaintiff has to prove that a loss occurred and that it was attributable to the defendant. The plaintiff must also be able to quantify the amount of loss in the eyes of the jury or judge.Actual damages are intended to provide the monetary amount necessary to replace what was lost and nothing more. Usually, compensatory damages are awarded in civil court cases in order to compensate for damages, injury, or another incurred loss. As we'll explore further in the article, they are different from punitive and treble damages.
