A reverse repurchase agreement (RRP), or reverse repo, is the sale of securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a higher price at a specific future date. A reverse repo refers to the seller side of a repurchase agreement (RP), or repo.These transactions, which often occur between two banks, are essentially collateralized loans. The difference between the original purchase price and the buyback price, along with the timing of the transaction (often overnight), equates to interest paid by the seller to the buyer. The reverse repo is the final step in the repurchase agreement, closing the contract.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Reverse Repurchase Agreement (RRP) or reverse repo is a financial transaction where securities are sold with an agreement to repurchase them at a higher price on a specific future date. The reverse repo is the seller in a repurchase agreement (RP) or repo. These transactions typically occur between two banks and essentially represent secured borrowing. The difference between the original purchase price and the repurchase price, along with the transaction time (usually overnight), equates to the interest paid by the seller to the buyer.
