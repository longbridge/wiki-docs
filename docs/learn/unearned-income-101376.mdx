The term unearned income refers to any income that is not acquired throughÂ work. Put simply, unearned income is any money you earn by doing nothing. This is in contrast to earned income, which is any compensation received for performing a service like work. There are many types of unearned or passive income, including interest from savings accounts, bond interest, alimony, and dividends from stocks.
