Trust property refers to assets that have been placed into a fiduciary relationship between a trustor and trustee for a designated beneficiary. Trust property may include any type of asset, including cash, securities, real estate, or life insurance policies. Trust property is also referred to as "trust assets" or "trust corpus."
