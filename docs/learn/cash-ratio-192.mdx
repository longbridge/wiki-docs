The ratio is calculated by dividing the company's cash and cash equivalents by its current liabilities. The formula is:</p><p>Cash&nbsp;Ratio=Cash&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cash&nbsp;Equivalentsâ€‹/Current&nbsp;Liabilities</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The cash ratio is an important financial metric that measures a company's short-term debt-paying ability. It is calculated by dividing a company's cash and cash equivalents by its current liabilities. The formula for the cash ratio is as follows:</p><p>Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the cash ratio originated in the early 20th century, as corporate financial management theories developed and became widely used. The earliest financial ratio analyses can be traced back to the 1920s when financial analysts began using various ratios to assess a company's financial health.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The cash ratio has the following key characteristics:<ul><li>Simple and Intuitive: The calculation formula is simple, easy to understand, and apply.</li><li>Conservative: It only considers cash and cash equivalents, excluding other current assets, making it a conservative measure.</li><li>Short-term Debt-paying Ability: It is primarily used to assess a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities in the short term.</li></ul>While the cash ratio does not have distinct categories, it can be compared with other liquidity ratios such as the current ratio and quick ratio.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>Case 1: A company holds $1 million in cash and cash equivalents and has $2 million in current liabilities. Its cash ratio is 0.5, meaning it has $0.5 in cash for every $1 of current liabilities.</li><li>Case 2: Another company holds $3 million in cash and cash equivalents and has $1.5 million in current liabilities. Its cash ratio is 2, indicating it has $2 in cash for every $1 of current liabilities, showing strong short-term debt-paying ability.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>What is a reasonable cash ratio? Generally, a cash ratio between 0.2 and 0.5 is considered reasonable, but it depends on the industry and the specific circumstances of the company.</li><li>What are the implications of a high or low cash ratio?
