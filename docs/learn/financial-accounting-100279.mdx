<p>Financial Accounting is a branch of accounting that focuses on recording, summarizing, and reporting an organization's financial transactions and status. The primary objective of financial accounting is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely financial information to external stakeholders such as investors, creditors, regulatory agencies, and tax authorities. Financial accounting adheres to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to ensure the comparability and consistency of financial statements. The main financial statements include the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements help stakeholders assess the financial health, profitability, and cash flow of an organization, enabling them to make informed decisions.</p>
