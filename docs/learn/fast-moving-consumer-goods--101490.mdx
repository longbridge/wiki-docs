Fast-moving consumer goods are products that sell quickly at relatively low cost. These goods are also called consumer packaged goods.FMCGs have a short shelf life because of high consumer demand (e.g., soft drinks and confections) or because they are perishable (e.g., meat, dairy products, and baked goods).These goods are purchased frequently, consumed rapidly, priced low, and sold in large quantities. They also have a high turnover when they're on the shelf at the store.
