<p>Fast-moving&nbsp;consumer goods&nbsp;(FMCGs) are products that sell quickly at relatively low cost. FMCGs have a short shelf life because of high consumer demand (e.g., soft drinks and confections) or because they are perishable (e.g., meat, dairy products, and baked goods).</p><p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(255,255,255)",color:"rgb(17,17,17)"}}>They are bought often, consumed rapidly, priced low, and sold in large quantities. They also have a high turnover on store shelves. The largest FMCG companies by revenue are among the best known, such as Nestle SA. (NSRGY) ($99.32 billion in 2023 earnings) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) ($91.47 billion). From the 1980s up to the early 2010s, the FMCG sector was a paradigm of stable and impressive growth; annual revenue was consistently around 9% in the first decade of this century, with returns on invested capital (ROIC) at 22%.</span></p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) are products that are sold quickly and at relatively low cost. Due to high consumer demand (e.g., soft drinks and candies) or perishability (e.g., meat, dairy products, and baked goods), FMCGs have a short shelf life.
