A loan commitment is an agreement by a commercial bank or other financial institution to lend a business or individual a specified sum of money. A loan commitment is useful for consumers looking to buy a home or a business planning to make a major purchase.The loan can take the form of a single lump sum or—in the case of an open-end loan commitment—a line of credit that the borrower can draw upon as needed (up to a predetermined limit).
