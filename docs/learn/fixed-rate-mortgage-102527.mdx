The term fixed-rate mortgage refers to a home loan that has a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the loan. This means that the mortgage carries a constant interest rate from beginning to end. Fixed-rate mortgages are popular products for consumers who want to know how much they have to pay every month. Fixed-rate mortgages may be open or closed with specific terms of 15 or 30 years or they may run for a length of time agreed upon by the lender and borrower.
