A genuine progress indicator (GPI) is a metric used to measure the economic growth of a country. It is often considered an alternative metric to the more well-known gross domestic product (GDP) economic indicator. The GPI indicator takes everything the GDP uses into account but adds other figures that represent the cost of the negative effects related to economic activity, such as the cost of crime, cost of ozone depletion, and cost of resource depletion, among others.The GPI nets the positive and negative results of economic growth to examine whether or not it has benefited people overall.
