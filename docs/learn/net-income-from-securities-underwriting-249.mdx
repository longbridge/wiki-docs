<AIContent content={`<h2>Net Income from Securities Underwriting Business</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Net income from securities underwriting business refers to the net income that a securities company earns from underwriting securities. Underwriting securities means that a securities company, acting as an intermediary, signs an underwriting agreement with the issuer according to the issuer's requirements, and sells the securities to investors through public offerings, private placements, etc., thereby providing financing services for the issuer.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The securities underwriting business originated in the 19th-century financial markets of Europe and America.

Firm commitment underwriting is characterized by higher risk but also higher returns, while best efforts underwriting has lower risk but also lower returns.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A company plans to issue stocks for financing and selects a securities company as the underwriter. The securities company, through firm commitment underwriting, promises to purchase unsold stocks at a price of 10 yuan per share. Eventually, the securities company successfully sells all the stocks and earns substantial underwriting income.</p><p>Case 2: Another company chooses the best efforts underwriting method for bond issuance. The securities company, acting as a sales agent, sells the bonds to investors and charges a commission. Since it does not bear the sales risk, the net income of the securities company is relatively low, but the risk is also lower.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. How should investors choose the appropriate underwriting method?<br/>Investors should choose the appropriate underwriting method based on their risk tolerance and financing needs. Firm commitment underwriting is suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance, while best efforts underwriting is suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance.</p><p>2.
