Frictional unemployment occurs with voluntary employment transitions within an economy. As workers choose to move from one job to another and new workers enter the workforce for the first time, a temporary period of unemployment is created.Frictional unemployment can be evident in a growing, stable economy and is regarded as a part of natural unemployment, the minimum unemployment rate in an economy due to economic forces and the movement of labor.The frictional unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the workers actively looking for jobs by the total labor force. The workers actively looking for jobs are typically classified into three categories: workers who left their job, people returning to the workforce, and new entrants.
