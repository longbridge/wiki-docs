Analyst consensus forecast refers to a method in which analysts predict and estimate financial indicators of a company, such as revenue, profit, market value, etc. Analysts conduct research and analysis on the company's financial statements, industry trends, and market environment to provide predictions for the company's future performance. Analyst consensus forecast is based on the research and opinions of multiple analysts, and can serve as a reference for investment decisions.
