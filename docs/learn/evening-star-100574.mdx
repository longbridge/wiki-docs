This pattern consists of three consecutive candlesticks: the first is a long bullish candlestick, indicating strong upward movement; the second is a small-bodied candlestick, which can be either bullish or bearish, showing market indecision; and the third is a long bearish candlestick, indicating a strong pullback. The appearance of the Evening Star pattern is generally considered a sell signal, as it suggests that the upward momentum is waning and a downward trend may follow.</span></p>
