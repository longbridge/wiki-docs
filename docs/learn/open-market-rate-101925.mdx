The open-market rate is the rate of interest paid on any debt security that trades in the open market. Interest rates for such debt instruments as commercial paper and banker's acceptances would fall under the category of open-market rates. Debt securities include government bonds, corporate bonds, certificate of deposit (CD), municipal bonds and preferred stock.
