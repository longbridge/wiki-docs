Whitemail is a defensive strategy that a takeover target can use to try to thwart a hostile takeover attempt. Whitemail involves the target firm issuing a large number of shares at below-market prices, which are then sold to a friendly third party.This helps the target avoid the takeover by increasing the number of shares the acquirer must purchase in order to gain control, thus increasing the price of the takeover. It also dilutes the firm's shares. Plus, since a friendly third party now owns and controls a large block of shares, the aggregate number of friendly shareholders increases.If the whitemail strategy is successful in discouraging the takeover, then the company can either buy back the issued shares or leave them outstanding.

<AIContent content={`<h2>White Knight Strategy</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The White Knight Strategy is a defensive tactic used by a target company to thwart hostile takeover attempts. This strategy involves issuing a large number of shares at a price below the market value and selling them to a friendly third party. This increases the number of shares the acquirer must purchase, thereby raising the acquisition cost.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The White Knight Strategy originated in the 1980s, a period marked by frequent corporate mergers and acquisitions. Companies began adopting various defensive strategies to prevent hostile takeovers, and the White Knight Strategy emerged as a way to dilute the hostile acquirer's shareholding by introducing friendly shareholders.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The White Knight Strategy has the following key characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Share Dilution:</strong> Issuing new shares dilutes existing shares, increasing the acquirer's cost.</li><li><strong>Introduction of Friendly Shareholders:</strong> Selling new shares to a friendly third party increases the number and control of friendly shareholders.</li><li><strong>Strong Defense:</strong> Effectively prevents hostile takeovers, protecting the company's independence.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Company A faces a hostile takeover. To counter this, Company A issues a large number of new shares at a price below the market value and sells them to a friendly investment firm B. As a result, the hostile acquirer C must purchase more shares to complete the takeover, significantly increasing the acquisition cost, leading C to abandon the takeover plan.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Company D, facing a hostile takeover, quickly issues new shares and sells them to several friendly institutional investors. These friendly shareholders collectively hold a significant portion of Company D's shares, successfully thwarting the hostile acquirer E's takeover attempt.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does the White Knight Strategy negatively impact existing shareholders?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, issuing new shares dilutes the existing shareholders' stake, which may lead to a drop in the share price.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is the White Knight Strategy always effective?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Not necessarily. If the hostile acquirer has sufficient funds, they may still complete the takeover. Additionally, the introduction of friendly shareholders may bring new management challenges.</p>`} id={101791} />
