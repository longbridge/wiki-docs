The KOF Economic Barometer is a composite indicator that provides a reliable reading on the direction of GDP growth for the Swiss economy compared with the same quarter a year earlier. The KOF Economic Barometer is based on a multi-sectoral design with three modules: core GDP, construction, and banking.The barometer has a complex structure because it bundles over 500 individual indicators in several steps. It is published monthly by the KOF Swiss Economic Institute.
