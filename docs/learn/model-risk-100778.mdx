Model risk is a type of risk that occurs when a financial model is used to measure quantitative information such as a firm's market risks or value transactions, and the model fails or performs inadequately and leads to adverse outcomes for the firm.A model is a system, quantitative method, or approach that relies on assumptions and economic, statistical, mathematical, or financial theories and techniques. The model processes data inputs into a quantitative-estimate type of output.Financial institutions and investors use models to identify the theoretical value of stock prices and to pinpoint trading opportunities. While models can be useful tools in investment analysis, they can also be prone to various risks that can occur from the usage of inaccurate data, programming errors, technical errors, and misinterpretation of the model's outputs.
