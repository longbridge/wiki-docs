An asset-based approach is a type of business valuation that focuses on a company's net asset value. The net asset value is identified by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. There is some room for interpretationÂ in terms of deciding which of the company's assets and liabilities to include in the valuation and how to measure the worth of each.
