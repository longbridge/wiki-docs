Zero-bound is an expansionary monetary policy tool where a central bank lowers short-term interest rates to zero, if needed, to stimulate the economy. A central bank that is forced to enact this policy must also pursue other, often unconventional, methods of stimulus to resuscitate the economy.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) is an expansionary monetary policy tool used when the economy needs stimulation, and the central bank lowers short-term interest rates to zero. Since interest rates cannot go below zero, the central bank must also adopt other unconventional measures to revive the economy.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the Zero Lower Bound gained attention in the 1990s, particularly in the context of Japan's prolonged economic stagnation. After the 2008 global financial crisis, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, frequently used this policy tool.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Zero Lower Bound policy mainly includes two types: traditional interest rate policy and unconventional monetary policy. Traditional interest rate policy involves lowering short-term interest rates to zero, while unconventional monetary policies include Quantitative Easing (QE) and Forward Guidance. These unconventional measures aim to stimulate the economy by increasing market liquidity and lowering long-term interest rates.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to near zero and implemented multiple rounds of Quantitative Easing by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to increase market liquidity. 2. In 2014, the European Central Bank also lowered the deposit rate below zero and launched an asset purchase program to address low inflation and economic weakness in the Eurozone.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does the Zero Lower Bound policy lead to inflation? Generally, the goal of the Zero Lower Bound policy is to avoid deflation by stimulating economic growth, but if over-implemented, it can indeed lead to inflation. 2. How effective is the Zero Lower Bound policy? The effectiveness of the Zero Lower Bound policy depends on the central bank's other unconventional measures and the market's response to these measures.</p>`} id={100138} />
