The future value of an annuity is the value of a group of recurring payments at a certain date in the future, assuming a particular rate of return, or discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the greater the annuity's future value. As long as all of the variables surrounding the annuity are known such as payment amount, projected rate, and number of periods, it is possible to calculate the future value of the annuity.
