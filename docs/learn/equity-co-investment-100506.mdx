An equity co-investment is a minority investment in a company made by investors alongside a private equity fund manager or venture capital (VC) firm. Equity co-investment enables other investors to participate in potentially highly profitable investments without paying the usual high fees charged by a private equity fund.Equity co-investment opportunities are typically restricted to large institutional investors who already have an existing relationship with the private equity fund manager and are often not available to smaller or retail investors.
