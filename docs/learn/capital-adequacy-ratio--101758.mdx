The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is an indicator of how well a bank can meet its obligations. Also known as the capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), the ratio compares capital to risk-weighted assets and is watched by regulators to determine a bank's risk of failure. It's used to protect depositors and promote the stability and efficiency of financial systems around the world.Two types of capital are measured:Tier-1 capital, core funds on hand to manage losses so that a bank can continue operating and,Tier-2 capital, a secondary supply of funds available from the sale of assets once a bank closes down.
