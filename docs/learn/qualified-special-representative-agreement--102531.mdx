The Qualified Special Representative Agreement (QSR) is an agreement between broker-dealers to clear trades without interacting with the NASDAQ ACT system. The QSR allows one broker-dealer to send trades directly to the National Securities Clearing Corporation on behalf of another broker-dealer. This method of clearing trades provides simpler processing, lower transaction costs, and extended trading hours.
