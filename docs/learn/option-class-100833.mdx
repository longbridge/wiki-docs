An option class refers to all the call options or all the put options listed on an exchange for a particular underlying asset. For example, all the calls available for trade on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock would be part of the same options class. All the puts listed on Apple would be part of another, related class.The number of options available for purchase or sale within a given option class will depend on the size and trading volume of the underlying asset, as well as overall market conditions.
