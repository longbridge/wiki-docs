The term E-mini refers to an electronically-traded futures contract that is a fraction of the size of a standard contract. E-minis are used to trade a variety of assets, such as commodities and currencies, but the most commonly traded assets using E-minis are indexes.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched the first E-mini futures contract in 1997 to give individual investors, for whom standard contract sizes were often too expensive, access to the futures market. Like other futures contracts, E-minis are traded on the CME and other exchanges, and allow investors to hedge their bets or speculate on the price movements of the underlying asset.
