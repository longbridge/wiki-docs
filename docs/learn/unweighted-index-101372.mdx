An unweighted index is comprised of securities with equal weight within the index. An equivalent dollar amount is invested in each of the index components. For an unweighted stock index, one stock's performance will not have a dramatic effect on the performance of the index as a whole.This differs from weighted indexes, where some stocks are given more percentage weight than others, usually based on their market capitalizations.
