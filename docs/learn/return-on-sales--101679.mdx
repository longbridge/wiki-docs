Return on sales (ROS) is a ratio used to evaluate a company's operational efficiency. This measure provides insight into how much profit is being produced per dollar of sales. An increasing ROS indicates that a company is improving efficiency, while a decreasing ROS could signal impending financial troubles. ROS is closely related to a firm's operating profit margin.

Its net profit margin is:<br/>Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Sales Revenue) × 100% = ($1 million / $10 million) × 100% = 10%. This means the company earns $0.10 in net profit for every dollar of sales.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company had a sales revenue of $5 million in 2023 and a net profit of $250,000.
