<p>Liquidity risk refers to the potential difficulty an entity may face in meeting its short-term financial obligations due to an inability to convert assets into cash without incurring a substantial loss. This risk is inherent in both financial institutions and corporations, significantly impacting their operational and financial stability.</p><p>Liquidity risk is often characterized by two main aspects: market liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk. Market liquidity risk is associated with an entity's inability to execute transactions at prevailing market prices due to insufficient market depth or disruptions. On the other hand, funding liquidity risk pertains to the inability to obtain sufficient funding to meet financial obligations.</p><p>Liquidity risk is not confined to any particular sector, as it is an important consideration across banks, financial institutions, corporations, and even some individual investors. For banks and financial institutions, liquidity risk management is underscored by regulatory frameworks that mandate certain liquidity standards to ensure financial stability and protect depositor interests. Corporations, too, need to be vigilant in managing liquidity risk to ensure they have adequate cash or credit lines to meet their operational and financial commitments. The ability to manage liquidity risk is essential for ensuring it has enough cash on hand to meet its short term needs and obligations.</p>
