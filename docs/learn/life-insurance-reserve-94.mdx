The amount of life insurance reserve required is determined by the insurance company based on risk assessment and the terms of the insurance contract.

The main categories include term life insurance reserves and whole life insurance reserves. Term life insurance reserves are typically used for short-term contracts, while whole life insurance reserves are for long-term contracts. Their features include precise actuarial calculations to ensure the adequacy and safety of the funds.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case Study 1: A major insurance company, when launching a new whole life insurance product, conducted detailed actuarial analysis to determine the amount of reserve needed to ensure it could meet all contractual obligations over the coming decades. Case Study 2: Another insurance company adjusted its life insurance reserve calculation method in response to changes in market interest rates to manage potential interest rate risks, ensuring the safety and stability of the funds.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face include determining the adequacy of the reserves and the impact of market changes on the reserves. Typically, insurance companies conduct regular actuarial assessments to ensure the adequacy of the reserves and adjust them according to market changes.
