Target-date funds are structured to maximize the investor's returns by a specific date. Generally, the funds are designed to build gains in the early years by focusing on riskier growth stocks, then they aim to retain those gains by weighting towards safer, more conservative choices as the target date approaches.Target-date mutual funds are often selected by investors saving towards retirement but are also used by people working towards a future big expense such as a child's college tuition.
