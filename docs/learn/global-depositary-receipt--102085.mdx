A global depositary receipt (GDR) is a negotiable financial instrument issued by a depositary bank. It represents shares in a foreign company and trades on the local stock exchanges in investors' countries.Â GDRs make it possible for a company (the issuer) to access investors in capital markets beyond the borders of its own country.GDRs are commonly used by issuers to raise capital from international investors through private placement or public stock offerings.A global depositary receipt is very similar to an American depositary receipt (ADR) except that an ADR only lists shares of a foreign company in U.S. markets.
