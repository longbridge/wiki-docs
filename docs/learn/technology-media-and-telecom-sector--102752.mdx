<p>The technology, media, and telecom (TMT) sector is an industry grouping that includes the majority of companies focused on new technologies. There is a substantial overlap between TMT and the 1990s idea of the new economy. The TMT sector is sometimes also referred to as technology, media, and communications (TMC).</p><p>The technology sector can no longer hold all the firms that depend on innovation because the role of technology in the economy has expanded. For example, Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and Netflix (NFLX) are both in the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) rather than the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK). Big tech companies increasingly dominate the TMT sector.</p>
