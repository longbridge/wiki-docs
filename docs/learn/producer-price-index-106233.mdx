The Producer Price Index (PPI) is an indicator that measures the changes in factory prices for production enterprises such as manufacturing and mining. It reflects the average price changes that producers receive when selling their products and can be used to evaluate inflationary pressures and economic activity levels. PPI typically includes prices for raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, among others.
