A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a type of smart contract used in blockchain applications. It reduces counterparty risk by creating a time-based escrow that requires a cryptographic passphrase for unlocking.In practical terms, this means that the person receiving the funds in a transaction has to perform two actions to access the funds: enter the correct passphrase and claim payment within a specific timeframe. If they enter an incorrect passphrase or do not claim the funds within the timeframe, they lose access to the payment.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) is a type of smart contract used in blockchain applications. It reduces counterparty risk by creating a time-based escrow mechanism. To unlock the funds, the recipient must provide a cryptographic passphrase and request payment within a specific time frame. If the recipient enters the wrong passphrase or fails to request payment within the stipulated time, they lose access to the funds.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of HTLC first appeared in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency cross-chain transactions. It was designed to address counterparty risk, ensuring that both parties can safely conduct transactions without a trust foundation. The application of HTLC has gradually expanded to other blockchain platforms and smart contracts.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> HTLC mainly has two types: single-chain HTLC and cross-chain HTLC.<ul><li><strong>Single-chain HTLC:</strong> This type of HTLC is used for transactions on the same blockchain. It is simple to implement and suitable for transactions within the same platform.</li><li><strong>Cross-chain HTLC:</strong> This type of HTLC is used for transactions between different blockchains. It is more complex but enables cross-chain asset transfers, suitable for scenarios requiring transactions between different blockchains.</li></ul>The main characteristics of HTLC include:<ul><li>Reducing counterparty risk: Ensures the safety of both parties' funds through time lock and passphrase mechanisms.</li><li>Automated execution: Smart contracts execute automatically without third-party intervention.</li><li>Flexibility: Can be applied to various blockchain platforms and transaction types.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Alice and Bob want to conduct a cross-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Alice sends Bitcoin to an HTLC address and generates a cryptographic passphrase. Bob creates an HTLC contract on Ethereum and provides the same passphrase. Alice enters the passphrase within the stipulated time to complete the transaction, and Bob also enters the passphrase within the stipulated time to complete the transaction. This way, both Alice and Bob can safely complete the cross-chain transaction.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Charlie and Dave conduct a transaction on the same blockchain. Charlie sends funds to an HTLC address and generates a cryptographic passphrase. Dave enters the passphrase within the stipulated time to complete the transaction. If Dave fails to enter the passphrase within the stipulated time, the funds automatically return to Charlie.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> What happens if the recipient forgets the passphrase?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> If the recipient forgets the passphrase, they will not be able to access the funds, and the funds will return to the sender.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is HTLC applicable to all blockchain platforms?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> HTLC is mainly applicable to blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. For blockchains that do not support smart contracts, the application of HTLC may be limited.</li></ul></p>`} id={102331} />
