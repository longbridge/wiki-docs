Bridge financing, often in the form of a bridge loan, is an interim financing option used by companies and other entities to solidify their short-term position until a long-term financing option can be arranged. Bridge financing normally comes from an investment bank or venture capital firm in the form of a loan or equity investment.Bridge financing is also used for initial public offerings (IPO) or may include an equity-for-capital exchange instead of a loan.
