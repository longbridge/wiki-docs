<p>Gann Angles are a technical analysis tool developed by the renowned financial analyst William D. Gann. They are used to predict future price movements in the market. Gann Angles are drawn from significant price points (such as highs or lows) to represent the relationship between price and time. Each Gann Angle line represents a different price-time ratio, such as 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, etc. The 1x1 line is considered the most important, representing an equilibrium between price and time.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Gann angles are a technical analysis tool developed by the renowned financial analyst William D. Gann, used to predict future market price movements. Gann angles are drawn from significant price points (such as highs or lows) to represent the relationship between price and time. Each Gann angle line represents a different price and time ratio, such as 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, etc. The 1x1 line is considered the most important, representing an equilibrium between price and time.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The origin of Gann angles dates back to the early 20th century when William D. Gann discovered a proportional relationship between price and time while studying market price fluctuations. The theoretical foundation of Gann angles is based on geometric and mathematical principles, particularly the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio. The application of Gann angles gradually gained recognition in financial markets and became an essential tool in technical analysis.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Gann angles are primarily divided into several types, each representing a different price and time ratio. Common Gann angle lines include 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 1x3, 3x1, etc.<ul><li><strong>1x1 Line:</strong> Represents an equilibrium between price and time and is the most important Gann angle line. If the price moves along the 1x1 line, it indicates a stable market condition.</li><li><strong>1x2 Line:</strong> Indicates that the price change rate is twice that of time, typically used to identify accelerating market trends.</li><li><strong>2x1 Line:</strong> Indicates that the time change rate is twice that of price, typically used to identify decelerating market trends.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> On a daily chart of a stock, an investor can draw a 1x1 Gann angle line from a significant low point. If the price moves upward along this line, it indicates a stable upward trend in the market. If the price breaks this line, it may signal a change in trend.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> In the forex market, a trader can draw a 2x1 Gann angle line from a significant high point. If the price moves downward along this line, it indicates a decelerating downward trend in the market. If the price breaks this line, it may signal a market rebound.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>How to choose the starting point?</strong> Choosing significant highs or lows as starting points is crucial, as these points are usually market turning points.</li><li><strong>Are Gann angle lines always accurate?</strong> Gann angle lines are a predictive tool and not absolutely accurate. Investors should use them in conjunction with other technical analysis tools for comprehensive judgment.</li></ul></p>`} id={100454} />
