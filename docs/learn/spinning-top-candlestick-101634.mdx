A spinning top is a candlestick pattern with a short real body that's vertically centered between long upper and lower shadows. The candlestick pattern represents indecision about the future direction of the asset. It means that neither buyers nor sellers could gain the upper hand.A candlestick pattern forms when the buyers push the price up during a given time period, and the sellers push the price down during the same time period, but ultimately the closing price ended up very close to the open. After a strong price advance or decline, spinning tops can signal a potential price reversal if the candle that follows confirms. A spinning top can have a close above or below the open, but the two prices are always close together.

This candlestick pattern represents indecision about the future direction of an asset's price. It indicates that neither buyers nor sellers could gain the upper hand. After a strong price rise or fall, if the subsequent candlestick confirms, the spinning top candlestick can signal a potential price reversal. The closing price of a spinning top candlestick can be higher or lower than the opening price, but the two prices are always very close.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The spinning top candlestick originated from Japanese candlestick charting techniques, which were first used by Japanese rice traders in the 18th century to record and predict rice prices. This technique was later adopted by Western financial markets and evolved into various patterns, including the spinning top candlestick.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The spinning top candlestick has the following characteristics: 1.
