The term high street bank refers to a large retail bankÂ that has many branch locations. High street banks are major, widespread institutions such as those found in the main commercial sector of a town or city. They offer everyday banking services such as deposit accounts and credit facilities to consumers and businesses. People generally refer to high street banks as such in order to differentiate them from other institutions such as investment banks. The term originated in the United Kingdom, where high street is commonly used as the British equivalent of Main Street.
