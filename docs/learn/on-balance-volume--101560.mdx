On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical trading momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. Joseph Granville first developed the OBV metric in the 1963 book .Granville believed that volume was the key force behind markets and designed OBV to project when major moves in the markets would occur based on volume changes. In his book, he described the predictions generated by OBV as "a spring being wound tightly." He believed thatÂ when volume increases sharply without a significant change in the stock's price, the price will eventually jump upward or fall downward.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a technical trading momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock prices. It accumulates daily trading volume to reflect market buying and selling pressure, helping investors gauge future price movements.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> OBV was first introduced by Joseph Granville in his 1963 book. Granville believed that volume was the key force in the market and designed OBV to predict significant market movements based on volume changes. He described OBV's predictive power as "a spring being wound tightly," meaning that when volume increases sharply without significant price changes, prices will eventually rise or fall.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> OBV has the following key characteristics:<ul><li>Simple to use: The calculation of OBV is relatively straightforward, requiring only the accumulation of daily trading volume.</li><li>Predictive ability: By observing changes in OBV, investors can predict potential price movements.</li><li>Trend confirmation: OBV can be used to confirm the validity of price trends. When OBV aligns with price movements, the trend is more reliable.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>Case 1: Suppose a stock's price remains stable over a period, but OBV continues to rise. This indicates that significant funds are quietly entering the market, potentially signaling an upcoming price increase.</li><li>Case 2: In another scenario, a stock's price is rising, but OBV is declining. This may indicate that the upward trend lacks volume support, suggesting a possible price reversal.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Is OBV applicable to all markets? OBV is primarily used in the stock market but can also be applied to other markets with volume data, such as futures and cryptocurrency markets.</li><li>What are the limitations of OBV? OBV only considers volume and not the magnitude of price fluctuations, which can sometimes lead to misleading signals.</li></ul></p>`} id={101560} />
