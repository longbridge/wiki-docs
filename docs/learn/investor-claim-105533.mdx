<AIContent content={`<h2>Investor Claims</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Investor claims refer to lawsuits filed by investors in court due to illegal activities in the securities market, aiming to protect investors' rights and maintain market fairness, justice, and transparency. Investor claims can generally be realized through the Securities Investor Protection Fund or law firms.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of investor claims originated during the development of the securities market, especially as the market became more mature and regulated.
