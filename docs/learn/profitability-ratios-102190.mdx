Profitability ratios are a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue, operating costs, balance sheet assets, or shareholders' equity over time, using data from a specific point in time. They are among the most popular metrics used in financial analysis.Profitability ratios can be a window into the financial performance and health of a business. Ratios are best used as comparison tools rather than as metrics in isolation.Profitability ratios can be used along with efficiency ratios, which consider how well a company uses its assets internally to generate income (as opposed to after-cost profits).
