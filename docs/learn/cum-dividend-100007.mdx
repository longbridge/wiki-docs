<p>Cum dividend refers to shares that are bought before the ex-dividend date, meaning the buyer is entitled to receive the upcoming dividend payment. In other words, when investors purchase cum dividend shares, they have the right to receive the dividend on the next payment date. Typically, after the ex-dividend date, the stock trades without this entitlement, and any shares purchased after this date will not receive the upcoming dividend.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cum dividend stocks refer to stocks purchased before the dividend declaration date, which are still entitled to receive the upcoming dividend. In other words, when investors buy cum dividend stocks, they are entitled to receive the dividend on the next dividend payment date. Usually, after the dividend declaration date, the stock will trade in an 'ex-dividend' state, meaning that stocks purchased during this period are no longer entitled to the upcoming dividend.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of cum dividend stocks originates from the development of the dividend payment system. The earliest dividend payments can be traced back to the 17th century with the Dutch East India Company, where the company would periodically pay a portion of its profits to shareholders. As capital markets developed, dividend payments became a common way for companies to reward shareholders, leading to the formation of the cum dividend concept.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Cum dividend stocks are mainly divided into common stocks and preferred stocks. Common stockholders are entitled to dividends when the company is profitable, but the amount and timing of dividends are not fixed. Preferred stockholders, on the other hand, enjoy fixed dividend payments and have priority over common stockholders in receiving remaining assets upon company liquidation. The characteristic of cum dividend stocks is that when purchased before the dividend declaration date, investors are entitled to the upcoming dividend, making them attractive in pre-declaration date trading.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. A company announces on September 1, 2024, that it will pay a dividend of $1 per share on October 1, 2024. If an investor purchases the company's stock on September 15, 2024, they will be entitled to receive the $1 per share dividend on October 1, 2024. 2. Another company announces on September 1, 2024, that it will pay a dividend of $0.5 per share on October 1, 2024. If an investor purchases the company's stock on September 20, 2024, since the stock has entered the ex-dividend state, the investor will no longer be entitled to this dividend.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <em>Why are cum dividend stocks more popular before the dividend declaration date?</em> Because investors can obtain the upcoming dividend by purchasing cum dividend stocks, thereby increasing their investment returns. 2. <em>Can stocks purchased on the ex-dividend date still receive dividends?</em> No, stocks purchased after the ex-dividend date are no longer entitled to the upcoming dividend.</p>`} id={100007} />
