A stock is cum dividend, which means "with dividend," when a company has declared that there will be a dividend in the future but has not yet paid it out. A stock will trade cum dividend until the ex-dividend date. After that, the stock trades without its dividend rights. When the buyer receives the next dividend scheduled for distribution, the share is cum dividend.
