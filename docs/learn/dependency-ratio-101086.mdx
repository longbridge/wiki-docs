<p>The dependency ratio is a measure of the number of dependents aged zero to 14 and over the age of 65, compared with the total population aged 15 to 64. This demographic indicator gives insight into the number of people of non-working age, compared with the number of those of working age.It is also used to understand the relative economic burden of the workforce and has ramifications for taxation.&nbsp;</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The dependency ratio is the ratio of the population aged 0-14 and 65 and over to the total population aged 15-64. This demographic indicator reveals the relationship between the number of non-working-age population and the working-age population. It is also used to understand the relative economic burden on the workforce and its impact on taxation.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the dependency ratio first appeared in the early 20th century and has been widely used as demography developed. It was initially used to assess the economic burden and pressure on the social security system of a country or region.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The dependency ratio is usually divided into two categories:<ul><li>Child Dependency Ratio: The ratio of the population aged 0-14 to the population aged 15-64.</li><li>Old-age Dependency Ratio: The ratio of the population aged 65 and over to the population aged 15-64.</li></ul>A high dependency ratio usually means a higher social and economic burden, as more resources are needed to support and care for the non-working-age population.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: In some developed countries, such as Japan, the old-age dependency ratio is high, which puts enormous pressure on the social security and healthcare systems.</li><li>Case 2: In some developing countries, such as India, the child dependency ratio is high, indicating a significant need for investment in education and infrastructure.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Question: Is a high dependency ratio always a bad thing?<br/>Answer: Not necessarily. A high dependency ratio may reflect a high birth rate or longer life expectancy, which can be positive signals in some contexts.</li><li>Question: How can the burden of a high dependency ratio be reduced?<br/>Answer: The economic burden of a high dependency ratio can be alleviated by increasing labor force participation, delaying retirement age, and boosting productivity.</li></ul></p>`} id={101086} />
