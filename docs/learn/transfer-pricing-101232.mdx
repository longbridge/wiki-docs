Transfer pricing is an accounting practice that represents the price that one division in a company charges another division for goods and services provided.Transfer pricing allows for the establishment of prices for the goods and services exchanged between subsidiaries, affiliates, or commonly controlled companies that are part of the same larger enterprise. Transfer pricing can lead to tax savings for corporations, though tax authorities may contestÂ their claims.
