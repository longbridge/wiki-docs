An offering circular is a type of prospectus provided for a new security listing. It is delivered to individuals and brokerage houses who are interested in potentially purchasing the newly issued securities. It is often slightly abbreviated from the final, long-form prospectus, but is still required to contain specific information.An offering circular should not be confused with a red herring or preliminary prospectus. The red herring is issued during the IPO process and is intended to generate interest in the new issue. It lacks many of the specifics regarding the new issue. The offering circular, on the other hand, is a more complete document and should be viewed before making a final decision about an investment.
