<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Full-year profit forecast is an estimate and prediction made by a company regarding its profitability for the entire year. It represents the expected profit level that the company anticipates achieving over the next year, and is typically used by investors and analysts to assess the company's operational status and potential returns.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of full-year profit forecast originated from the need for financial management and investment analysis within companies.
