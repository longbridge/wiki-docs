Weighted average maturity (WAM) is the weighted average amount of time until the maturities on mortgages in a mortgage-backed security (MBS). This term is used more broadly to describe maturities in a portfolio of debt securities, including corporate debt and municipal bonds. The higher the WAM, the longer it takes for all of the mortgages or bonds in the portfolio to mature.Â WAM is used to manage debt portfolios and to assess the performance of debt portfolio managers.WAM is closely related to weighted average loan age (WALA).
