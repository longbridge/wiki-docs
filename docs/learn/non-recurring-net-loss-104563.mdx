Non-recurring net loss refers to the net loss after deducting non-recurring gains and losses. Non-recurring gains and losses refer to one-time income or expenses that are unrelated to the company's daily operations. Non-recurring net loss can better reflect the company's operating performance.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-recurring net loss refers to the net loss after deducting non-recurring gains and losses. Non-recurring gains and losses are one-time incomes or expenses unrelated to the company's daily operating activities. Non-recurring net loss can better reflect the company's operating performance.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-recurring net loss originated in the field of financial analysis to more accurately assess a company's operating condition. As the complexity of corporate financial statements increased, investors and analysts needed a method to exclude those non-sustainable and non-representative incomes or expenses to better understand the company's actual operating capabilities.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-recurring net loss is mainly divided into two categories: net loss after deducting non-recurring income and net loss after deducting non-recurring expenses. The former usually includes one-time incomes such as asset sales and government subsidies, while the latter includes one-time expenses such as natural disaster losses and litigation compensations. The characteristic of non-recurring net loss is that it can exclude those non-sustainable and non-representative financial data, thereby more accurately reflecting the company's operating performance.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company reported a net profit of 10 million yuan in a certain year, but this included a 5 million yuan government subsidy. After deducting this non-recurring income, the company's non-recurring net profit is 5 million yuan. If the company also incurred a 3 million yuan natural disaster loss in the same year, the non-recurring net loss would be -2 million yuan. Case 2: Another company reported a net loss of 2 million yuan in a certain year, but this included a 1 million yuan asset sale income. After deducting this non-recurring income, the company's non-recurring net loss is 3 million yuan.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> Common questions investors may have when applying the concept of non-recurring net loss include how to accurately identify non-recurring gains and losses and how to handle non-recurring items that occur multiple times. A common misconception is mistaking certain sustainable but infrequent items as non-recurring gains and losses.</p>`} id={104563} />
