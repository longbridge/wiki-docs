A Godfather offer is an irrefutable takeover bid made to a target company by an acquirer. Typically, the offer is priced at an extremely generous premium compared with the target's prevailing share price, making it difficult for management to reject the bid without angering shareholders and being accused of breaching their fiduciary duty.A Godfather offer is named after the Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same title. More specifically, the name refers to the film's famous line, "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." This line has gone on to become one of the most celebrated quotations in cinema.
