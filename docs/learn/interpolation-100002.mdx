Interpolation is a statistical method by which related known values are used to estimate an unknown value or set of values. In investing, interpolation is used to estimate prices or the potential yield of a security. Interpolation is achieved by using other established values that are located in sequence with the unknown value.If there is a generally consistent trend across a set of data points, one can reasonably estimate the value of the set at points that haven't been explicitly calculated. Investors and stock analysts frequently create a line chart with interpolated data points. These charts help them visualize the changes in the price of securities and are an important part of technical analysis.Interpolation can be compared with extrapolation, which estimates unknown values that extend beyond the known data, rather than values that fall in between known data points.
