<p>Held-to-maturity (HTM) securities are purchased to be owned until maturity. For example, a company's management might invest in a bond that they plan to hold to maturity. There are different accounting treatments for HTM securities compared to securities that are liquidated in the short term.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>Held-to-Maturity (HTM) securities are debt securities that an investor intends and is able to hold until maturity. These typically include corporate bonds, government bonds, etc. A key characteristic of HTM securities is that the investor has a clear intention and ability to hold them until they mature at the time of purchase.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of held-to-maturity originates from accounting standards requirements, particularly the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These standards require companies to classify securities based on their investment intentions and abilities, affecting how they are presented in financial statements.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <em>Fixed Income:</em> HTM securities are typically fixed-income securities, providing investors with regular interest income during the holding period.<br/>2. <em>Low Risk:</em> Since investors plan to hold these securities until maturity, market price fluctuations have minimal impact on their financial statements.<br/>3. <em>Accounting Treatment:</em> HTM securities are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost, without the need for periodic revaluation to fair value.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <em>Corporate Bonds:</em> A company purchases a batch of 5-year corporate bonds and plans to hold them until maturity. These bonds pay fixed interest annually, and the company classifies them as HTM securities in its financial statements, measuring them at amortized cost.<br/>2. <em>Government Bonds:</em> A bank buys 10-year government bonds, intending to hold them until maturity to earn stable interest income. The bank classifies these bonds as HTM securities in its financial statements, measuring them at amortized cost.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <em>If market interest rates change, will the value of HTM securities be affected?</em><br/>While changes in market interest rates can affect the market price of HTM securities, these securities are measured at amortized cost, so market price fluctuations do not directly impact financial statements.<br/>2. <em>What happens if a company changes its holding intention?</em><br/>If a company decides not to hold the securities until maturity, it must reclassify them and measure them at fair value, which could significantly impact the financial statements.</p>`} id={101831} />
