War economy is the organization of a country's production capacity and distribution during a time of conflict. A war economy must make substantial adjustments to its consumer production to accommodate defense production needs. In a war economy, governments must choose how to allocate their countryâ€™s resources very carefully in order to achieve military victory while also meeting vital domestic consumer demands.
