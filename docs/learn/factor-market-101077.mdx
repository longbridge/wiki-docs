"Factor market" is a term economists use for all of the resources that businesses use to purchase, rent, or hire what they need in order to produce goods or services. Those needs are the factors of production, which include raw materials, land, labor, and capital.The factor market is also called the input market. By this definition, all markets are either factor markets, where businesses obtain the resources they need, or goods and services markets, where consumers make their purchases.
