<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Underwriting and sponsorship refer to the services provided by investment banks or financial institutions during the securities issuance process, including underwriting new stock issues and acting as sponsors for the issuance. Underwriting and sponsorship institutions help issuers complete various stages of securities issuance, such as pricing, sales, and distribution, ensuring successful issuance and compliance with regulatory requirements, while also bearing certain market risks.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of underwriting and sponsorship originated in the United States in the 19th century when investment banks began offering securities issuance services to companies. As capital markets developed, this service gradually evolved into the modern underwriting and sponsorship system. By the early 20th century, with the standardization of securities markets, underwriting and sponsorship became a crucial part of securities issuance.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Underwriting and sponsorship can be mainly divided into two categories: firm commitment underwriting and best efforts underwriting.<ul><li><strong>Firm Commitment Underwriting:</strong> The underwriter commits to purchasing all unsold securities from the issuer, bearing higher market risk but also earning higher underwriting fees.</li><li><strong>Best Efforts Underwriting:</strong> The underwriter only agrees to sell the securities without bearing the risk of unsold portions, resulting in relatively lower underwriting fees.</li></ul>Characteristics of underwriting and sponsorship include:<ul><li>High Professionalism: Requires underwriters to have extensive market experience and professional knowledge.</li><li>Risk Bearing: Underwriters bear market risk in firm commitment underwriting.</li><li>Strict Regulation: Must comply with relevant laws and regulations to ensure the issuance process is compliant.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A tech company plans to list on NASDAQ and selects a well-known investment bank as its underwriter and sponsor. The bank is responsible for developing the issuance plan, pricing strategy, and distributing the stock through its sales network. Ultimately, the company successfully raises the required funds and goes public.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A traditional manufacturing company plans to issue bonds and selects a large financial institution as its underwriter and sponsor. The institution assists the company in market research, determining the issuance size and interest rate, and successfully sells the bonds through its client resources, helping the company secure long-term financing.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Q:</strong> How do underwriting and sponsorship institutions determine pricing?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Underwriting and sponsorship institutions typically conduct market research, analyze investor demand and market conditions, and consider the issuer's financial status and future prospects to develop a reasonable pricing strategy.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Do underwriting and sponsorship institutions bear all the risks?<br/><strong>A:</strong> In firm commitment underwriting, the underwriter bears the market risk of unsold securities; in best efforts underwriting, the risk is primarily borne by the issuer.</li></ul></p>`} id={312} />
