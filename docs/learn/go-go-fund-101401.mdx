Go-go fund is a slang name for a mutual fund that has an investment strategy focused on high-risk securities in an attempt to capture above-average returns. A go-go fund's aggressive approach usually involves holding large positions in growth stocks. Growth stocks offer higher risks, but also higher potential returns.
