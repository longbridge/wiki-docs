TheÂ nominal rate of return is the amount of money generated by an investment before factoring in expenses such as taxes, investment fees, and inflation. If an investment generated a 10% return, the nominal rate would equal 10%. After factoring in inflation during the investment period, the actual ("real") return would likely be lower.However, the nominal rate of return has its merits since it allows investors to compare the performance of an investment irrespective of the different tax rates that might be applied for each investment.
