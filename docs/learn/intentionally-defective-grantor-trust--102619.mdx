An intentionally defective grantor (IDGT) trustÂ is an estate-planning tool used to freeze certain assets of an individual for estate tax purposes but not for income tax purposes. The intentionally defective trust is created as a grantor trust with a loophole that allows the them to receive income from certain trust assets.The grantor pays income tax on any generated income, but the estate does not incur any estate taxes when the grantor dies.
