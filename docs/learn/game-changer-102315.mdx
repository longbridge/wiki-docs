Throughout time, certain ideas have changed how people live, how societies function, and even the course of history. These ideas have been brought to life by individuals who considered things as they were, envisioned what could be, and committed to creating the changes that they believed in.Those people are sometimes referred to as game-changers. Think Johannes Gutenberg and the printing press, Thomas Edison and the electric light, Andrew Fleming and the antibiotic penicillin, or Alan Turing and the first modern computer.Game-changers are those people who bring the force of their vision, will, and personality to bear on the sometimes unique, sometimes mundane ideas that can alter the ways in which we live.Game-changer can also refer to a company that significantly switches things up and develops new business plans and strategies that place it above its competition.Game-changers can drive changes that transform the landscape in which we live, on either small or large scales.
