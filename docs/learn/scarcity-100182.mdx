Scarcity is an economics concept rooted in one of the most basic facts of life: we live in a world of limited resources that requires choices about how they are allocated. In that sense, every product down to a pack of gum or a book of matches is scarce, since someone expended resources that could have been deployed elsewhere to produce it.Scarcity is so fundamental to economics that scarce goods are also known as economic goods. In economics, scarce goods are those for which demand would exceed supply at a price of zero.Some natural resources that may appear to be free because they are easily and widely accessible eventually prove scarce as they are depleted from overuse in a tragedy of the commons. Economists increasingly view clean air and a climate compatible with human welfare as scarce goods because of the significant cost of protecting them, and may place a price on them for the purposes of a cost-benefit analysis.
