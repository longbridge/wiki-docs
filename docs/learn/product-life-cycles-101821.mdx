The term product life cycle refers to the length of time from when a product is introduced to consumers into the market until it's removed from the shelves. This concept is used by management and by marketing professionals as a factor in deciding when it is appropriate to increase advertising, reduce prices, expand to new markets, or redesign packaging. The process of strategizing ways to continuously support and maintain a product is called product life cycle management.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Product Life Cycle</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The product life cycle refers to the duration from a product's market introduction to its withdrawal. Management and marketing professionals use this concept to decide when to increase advertising, lower prices, expand into new markets, or redesign packaging. The process of continuously supporting and maintaining a product is known as product life cycle management.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of the product life cycle was first introduced by American economist Raymond Vernon in 1966. While studying international trade patterns, he observed that products in the market could be divided into different stages, each with unique characteristics and strategic needs.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The product life cycle is typically divided into four stages: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline.</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction:</strong> The product is newly launched in the market, sales are low, and marketing and advertising costs are high.</li><li><strong>Growth:</strong> The product gains market acceptance, sales increase rapidly, and profits rise.</li><li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Sales peak, market competition intensifies, and profits stabilize or decline.</li><li><strong>Decline:</strong> Sales and profits decrease as the market becomes saturated or the product is replaced by new innovations.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1: Smartphones</strong><br/>In the introduction stage, only a few high-end smartphones were available, and prices were high. As technology advanced and market acceptance grew, smartphones entered the growth stage with rapidly increasing sales. During the maturity stage, numerous brands and models emerged, leading to intense competition and stable prices. Eventually, with the advent of new technologies (e.g., foldable screens, 5G), older smartphone models entered the decline stage.</p><p><strong>Case 2: DVD Players</strong><br/>In the introduction stage, DVD players were expensive and had low market acceptance. With the push from the movie and entertainment industry, DVD players entered the growth stage with significant sales increases. During the maturity stage, almost every household owned a DVD player, and the market became saturated. Finally, with the rise of Blu-ray players and streaming services, DVD players entered the decline stage.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can you determine which stage of the product life cycle a product is in?<br/><strong>A:</strong> You can determine the stage by analyzing sales data, market share, competition, and profit margins.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the main challenges of product life cycle management?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The main challenges include accurately predicting market changes, timely adjusting marketing strategies, and effectively managing resources at different stages.</p>`} id={101821} />
