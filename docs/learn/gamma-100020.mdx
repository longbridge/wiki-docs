Gamma (Γ) is an options risk metric that describes the rate of change in an option's delta per one-point move in the underlying asset's price. Delta is how much an option's premium (price) will change given a one-point move in the underlying asset's price. Therefore, gamma is a measure of how the rate of change of an option's price will change with fluctuations in the underlying price. The higher the gamma, the more volatile the price of the option is.Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a derivative's value in relation to the underlying asset. It is one of the "options Greeks" along with delta, rho, theta, and vega. These are used to assess the different types of risk in options portfolios.
