<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Credit asset impairment loss refers to the estimated loss recognized by financial institutions due to the decline in the value of credit assets. Credit assets include bank loans, bonds, etc. When the expected recovery amount of these assets is lower than their book value, financial institutions will recognize a credit asset impairment loss.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of credit asset impairment loss originated from the development of financial accounting standards. As financial markets became more complex and globalized, financial institutions needed to more accurately reflect the true value of their assets. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced relevant standards, such as IAS 39 and ASC 326, to regulate the measurement and reporting of credit asset impairments.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Credit asset impairment losses are mainly divided into two categories: Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Actual Credit Loss.<ul><li><strong>Expected Credit Loss (ECL):</strong> Estimated based on potential future credit losses, usually using statistical models and historical data for prediction. It is characterized by its forward-looking nature, allowing for early reflection of potential risks.</li><li><strong>Actual Credit Loss:</strong> Based on credit events that have already occurred, such as borrower defaults. It is characterized by its retrospective nature, accurately reflecting known losses.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Bank Loan Impairment:</strong> A bank issued a loan to a company, but due to the company's poor performance, it is expected to be unable to repay the loan in full. The bank, using an expected credit loss model, estimates that the recovery amount of the loan will be lower than its book value, thus recognizing a credit asset impairment loss.</li><li><strong>Bond Investment Impairment:</strong> An investment institution holds a batch of corporate bonds, but due to the deteriorating financial condition of the issuing company, the market value of the bonds has significantly declined. The investment institution recognizes the impairment loss of the bonds based on actual credit loss.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>How to determine the impairment amount?</strong> Financial institutions typically use expected credit loss models, combining historical data and future forecasts, to estimate the impairment amount.</li><li><strong>Will impairment losses affect financial statements?</strong> Yes, credit asset impairment losses directly impact the financial institution's profit and balance sheet, reflected in the impairment loss item in the income statement.</li></ul></p>`} id={26} />
