<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Credit asset impairment loss refers to the estimated loss recognized by financial institutions due to the decline in the value of credit assets. Credit assets include bank loans, bonds, etc. When the expected recovery amount of these assets is lower than their book value, financial institutions recognize a credit asset impairment loss.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of credit asset impairment loss developed with the evolution of the modern financial system. In the late 20th century, as financial markets became more complex and globalized, the credit risk faced by financial institutions increased, prompting accounting standards to gradually introduce the concept of impairment loss to more accurately reflect the true value of assets.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Credit asset impairment loss is mainly divided into two categories: expected credit loss and incurred credit loss. Expected credit loss is an estimate based on potential future losses, while incurred credit loss is recognized based on currently known loss situations. The introduction of the expected credit loss model allows financial institutions to identify and address potential credit risks earlier.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>During the 2008 financial crisis, many banks such as Citibank and Bank of America experienced significant credit asset impairment losses. These banks, holding large amounts of subprime mortgage-related assets, had to recognize substantial impairment losses when the market value of these assets plummeted. Additionally, Deutsche Bank in Europe also recognized significant credit asset impairment losses in 2016 due to its portfolio of non-performing loans.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand credit asset impairment loss as merely an accounting adjustment, overlooking its real impact on a company's profitability and capital adequacy. Moreover, accurately predicting future credit losses remains a major challenge for financial institutions.</p>`} id={26} />
