<p>The max pain price refers to a specific strike price at which the total value loss of expiring call and put options is the greatest. In other words, "max pain" is the strike price at which the highest number of options (whether calls or puts) expire worthless. The term originates from the max pain theory, which posits that most traders who buy and hold option contracts until expiration will incur losses.</p>

In other words, the Max Pain Price is the strike price at which the largest number of options (both calls and puts) expire worthless.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the Max Pain Price originates from the Max Pain Theory, which posits that most traders who buy and hold options contracts until expiration will incur losses. This theory was first proposed in the 1990s and has gradually gained recognition and application among options traders.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Max Pain Price is primarily applied in the options market, especially for stock options and index options.

Calculations show that the Max Pain Price is $105. This means that at the $105 strike price, the total value loss of expiring call and put options is the greatest. Traders can use this information to predict that the stock price may gravitate towards $105 before expiration.</li><li>Another example is an index option with a Max Pain Price of 3000 points.
