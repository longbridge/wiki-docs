Weak shorts refer to traders or investors who hold a short position in a stock or other financial asset who will exit at the first indication of price strength. Weak shorts are typically investors with limited financial capacity, precluding them from taking absorbing too much risk on a short position. A weak short will generally have a tight stop-loss order in place on the short position to cap the loss on the short trade. Weak shorts are conceptually similar to weak longs, though the latter employ long positions.
