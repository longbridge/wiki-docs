The Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG) refers to a set of international guidelines produced by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and adopted in 1991. These guidelines set forth generally agreed-upon rules governing securing payments and meeting performance guarantees in contracts among global trading partners.In general, the URDG guidelines outline the rights and obligations of parties underÂ demand guarantees. A demand guarantee is a type of protection that one party in a transaction can impose on another party in the event that the second party does not perform according to predefined specifications.According to the ICC, many bankers, traders, and industry associations recognize and accept the URDG because it attempts to balance the interests of all parties involved in various types of international contracts.Both the World Bank and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) each have adopted the URDG standard.
