Accidental death benefit is a payment due to the beneficiary of an accidental death insurance policy, which is often a clause or rider connected to a life insurance policy. The accidental death benefit (ADB) life insurance policy usually pays in addition to the standard benefit payable if the insured died of natural causes.Depending on the policy’s issuer, an accidental death benefit may extend up to a year after the initial accident occurs, provided that the accident led to the insured’s death.
