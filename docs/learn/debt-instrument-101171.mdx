A debt instrument is any financial tool used to raise capital. It is a documented, binding obligation between two parties in which one party lends funds to another, with the repayment method specified in a contract. Some are secured by collateral, and most involve interest, a schedule for payments, and time frame to maturity if it has a maturity date.
