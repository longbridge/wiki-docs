<p>The term "labor-intensive" refers to a process or industry that requires a large amount of labor to produce its goods or services.&nbsp;</p><p>The degree of labor intensity is typically measured in proportion to the amount of capital required to produce the goods or services: the higher the proportion of labor costs required, the more labor-intensive the business.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Labor-intensive refers to a process or industry that requires a large amount of labor to produce its goods or services. The degree of labor intensity is usually measured by the proportion of capital required to produce goods or services: the higher the proportion of labor costs, the higher the labor intensity of the enterprise.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of labor-intensive industries originated during the Industrial Revolution when a large amount of manual labor was used to produce goods. Over time, especially in the mid-20th century, many developing countries began to rely on labor-intensive industries to drive economic growth and employment.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Labor-intensive industries can be divided into various types, including manufacturing (e.g., textiles, clothing, toy manufacturing), services (e.g., catering, cleaning services), and agriculture (e.g., planting, harvesting). The common characteristics of these industries are that they require a large amount of manual operation, have relatively low technical content, and are usually sensitive to labor costs. The advantage is that they can provide a large number of employment opportunities, while the disadvantage is that they are easily affected by rising labor costs and technological advancements.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. China's textile industry: In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, China's textile industry developed rapidly, becoming the world's largest producer and exporter of textiles. This industry relies on a large amount of cheap labor, driving China's rapid economic growth. 2. India's IT outsourcing services: Although the IT industry is usually considered technology-intensive, India's IT outsourcing services rely on a large number of basic-trained laborers to provide cost-effective services to global companies.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Will labor-intensive industries disappear with technological advancements? Although technological advancements may reduce the demand for labor, certain labor-intensive industries will still exist, especially in regions with lower labor costs. 2. What are the risks of investing in labor-intensive industries? The main risks include rising labor costs, technological substitution, and changes in market demand.</p>`} id={101492} />
