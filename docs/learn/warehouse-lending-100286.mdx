Warehouse lending is a line of credit given to a loan originator. The funds are used to pay for a mortgage that a borrower uses to purchase property. The life of the loan generally extends from its origination to the time it is sold on the secondary market either directly or through securitization.The repayment of warehouse lines of credit is ensured by lenders through charges on each transaction, in addition to charges when loan originators post collateral.
