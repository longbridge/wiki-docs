Other current liabilities, in financial accounting, are categories of short-term debt that are lumped together on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The term "current liabilities" refers to items of short-term debt that a firm must pay within 12 months. To that, companies add the word "other" to describe those current liabilities that are not significant enough to identify separately on their own lines in financial statements, so they are grouped together as "other current liabilities."Other current liabilities may be contrasted with other current assets, found on the assets side of the balance sheet.
