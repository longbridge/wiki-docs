Net interest income refers to the net income obtained by a company during a certain period by deducting the interest expenses paid to borrowers or bondholders from the interest income obtained from borrowers through loans, bonds, and other means. Net interest income is an important indicator for measuring a company's debt management and profitability.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Net interest income refers to the net earnings a company obtains over a certain period from interest income through loans, bonds, etc., minus the interest expenses paid to lenders or bondholders. It is a crucial indicator of a company's debt management and profitability.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of net interest income developed alongside the modern financial system. While interest income records date back to ancient civilizations, as a systematic financial metric, it became widely used in the 20th century with the expansion of banking and financial markets.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Net interest income is primarily categorized into positive and negative net interest income. Positive net interest income indicates that a company's interest income exceeds its interest expenses, usually signifying good financial health. Negative net interest income suggests a heavier burden of interest expenses. The feature of net interest income is that it directly reflects a company's debt management capability and profitability.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A bank in 2022 earned $50 million in interest income from loans while paying $20 million in interest expenses, resulting in a net interest income of $30 million, indicating effective interest management. Case 2: A manufacturing company in 2023 earned $10 million in interest income but had $15 million in interest expenses due to high debt, resulting in a negative net interest income of $5 million, highlighting financial stress.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misconstrue net interest income as the total profitability of a company, overlooking other income and expenses. Another common issue is failing to consider the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, especially in volatile market environments.</p>`} id={62} />
