A real estate investment group (REIG) refers to a business that focuses the majority of its efforts and capital on real estate. In search of profits, real estate investment groups may choose to buy, renovate, sell, or finance properties. Real estate investment groups commonly buy out multi-unit properties, selling units to investors while taking responsibility for administration and maintenance of the property.Typically, real estate investment groups either do not elect or do not qualify to be a real estate investment trust (REIT).
