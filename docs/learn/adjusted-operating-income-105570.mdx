Adjusted operating profit refers to a company's operating profit after deducting some non-recurring items. These non-recurring items may be income or expenses that do not belong to the company's normal business activities. Adjusted operating profit can be used to evaluate a company's operating performance, as it reflects the true profit of the company's normal operating activities.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Adjusted Operating Profit</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Adjusted operating profit refers to the operating profit of a company after excluding certain non-recurring items. These non-recurring items can be either income or expenses that are not part of the company's regular business activities. Adjusted operating profit is used to evaluate the company's operational performance as it reflects the true profit from normal business operations.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of adjusted operating profit originated from the need for financial analysis, especially in the late 20th century. As the complexity of corporate financial statements increased, investors and analysts required a more accurate method to assess a company's operational performance. By excluding non-recurring items, adjusted operating profit provides a clearer view, helping to understand the core profitability of a company.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Adjusted operating profit mainly includes the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Exclusion of one-time income:</strong> Such as gains from the sale of assets, which are not sustainable.</li><li><strong>Exclusion of one-time expenses:</strong> Such as restructuring costs or legal settlements, which do not reflect the company's daily operations.</li><li><strong>Exclusion of non-operating items:</strong> Such as investment gains or losses, which are unrelated to the company's core business.</li></ul><p>These adjustments make adjusted operating profit more reflective of the company's actual operating conditions, facilitating decision-making for investors and management.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> In 2023, a company sold a piece of land, generating a one-time gain of 5 million yuan. Without adjustment, this gain would significantly increase the company's operating profit, but it does not reflect the company's regular operating capability. By using adjusted operating profit, this 5 million yuan is excluded, providing a more accurate assessment of the company's operational performance.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company underwent a major restructuring in 2024, incurring restructuring costs of 3 million yuan. These costs are one-time and will not recur in future financial statements. By using adjusted operating profit, this 3 million yuan is excluded, offering a clearer understanding of the company's normal operating conditions.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why use adjusted operating profit?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Adjusted operating profit excludes non-recurring items, making financial statements more reflective of the company's actual operating conditions, aiding investors and management in making more accurate decisions.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is adjusted operating profit completely accurate?<br/><strong>A:</strong> While adjusted operating profit provides a clearer view, it should still be combined with other financial metrics and analysis methods for a comprehensive evaluation.</p>`} id={105570} />
