The Fourth World is an outdated term used to describe the most underdeveloped, poverty-stricken, and marginalized regions of the world.Many inhabitants of these nations do not have any political ties and are often hunter-gatherers that live in nomadic communities, or are part of tribes. They may be fully functional and self-surviving but during the Cold War were ascribed Fourth World status based on their economic performance.
