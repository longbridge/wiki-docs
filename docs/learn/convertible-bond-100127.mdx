<AIContent content={`<h2>Convertible Bonds</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Convertible bonds are a type of fixed-income corporate debt security that provides interest payments but can be converted into a certain number of common shares or equity shares. The conversion of bonds into stocks can occur at certain times during the bond's life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder. As a hybrid security, the price of convertible bonds is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, the underlying stock price, and the issuer's credit rating.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of convertible bonds dates back to the late 19th century in the United States. At that time, railroad companies began issuing these bonds to raise funds, offering both fixed income and the option to convert into company stock. Over time, this financial instrument was adopted by other industries and gained widespread use globally.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Convertible bonds are mainly divided into two categories: mandatory convertible bonds and optional convertible bonds. Mandatory convertible bonds must be converted into stock under certain conditions, while optional convertible bonds allow the holder to decide whether to convert. The main characteristics of convertible bonds include:</p><ul><li>Fixed Income: Bondholders receive fixed interest payments during the bond's life.</li><li>Conversion Right: Bondholders can convert the bonds into the issuing company's stock under specific conditions.</li><li>Risk Hedging: Due to their hybrid nature, convertible bonds allow investors to hedge against market risks to some extent.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A tech company issues a batch of convertible bonds with a face value of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, and a term of 5 years. Investor A purchases these bonds and, after holding them for two years, notices a significant increase in the company's stock price. Investor A decides to convert the bonds into stock, thereby achieving a higher investment return.</p><p>Case 2: A retail company issues a batch of mandatory convertible bonds with a face value of $500, an annual interest rate of 4%, and a term of 3 years. According to the terms, these bonds will automatically convert into company stock upon maturity. Investor B purchases these bonds and receives the corresponding number of shares at maturity. Despite fluctuations in the company's stock price during the period, Investor B ultimately gains stable returns.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. How is the conversion ratio of convertible bonds determined?<br/>The conversion ratio is usually determined at the time of bond issuance and is specified in the bond terms. It is typically based on the bond's face value and the predetermined conversion price.</p><p>2. What are the risks associated with convertible bonds?<br/>The main risks of convertible bonds include interest rate risk, credit risk, and market risk. Rising interest rates may lead to a decrease in bond prices, a downgrade in the issuer's credit rating may increase default risk, and fluctuations in the underlying stock price directly affect the conversion value.</p>`} id={100127} />
