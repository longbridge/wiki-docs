A trailing stop is a modification of a typical stop order that can be set at a defined percentage or dollar amount away from a security's current market price. For a long position, an investor places a trailing stop loss below the current market price. For a short position, an investor places the trailing stop above the current market price.A trailing stop is designed to protect gains by enabling a trade to remain open and continue to profit as long as the price is moving in the investorâ€™s favor. The order closes the trade if the price changes direction by a specified percentage or dollar amount.A trailing stop is typically placed at the same time the initial trade is placed, although it may also be placed after the trade.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A trailing stop is a modified version of a typical stop order that can be set at a certain percentage or dollar amount away from the current market price of a stock. For long positions, investors place the trailing stop order below the current market price. For short positions, investors place the trailing stop order above the current market price. The purpose of a trailing stop is to protect gains by keeping the trade open and allowing profit to run as long as the price moves in the investor's favor. If the price changes direction by the specified percentage or dollar amount, the order will close the trade. Trailing stops are usually placed at the same time as the initial trade, although they can also be placed after the trade.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of trailing stops originated from traditional stop orders, but its flexibility and dynamic adjustment features have made it widely used in modern financial markets.
