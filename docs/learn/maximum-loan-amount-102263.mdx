A maximum loan amount, or loan limit, describes the total amount of money that an applicant is authorized to borrow. Maximum loan amounts are used for standard loans, credit cards, and line-of-credit accounts.The maximum will depend on several factors including a borrower's creditworthiness, length of the loan, loan purpose, whether the loan is backed by collateral, as well as various criteria of the lender.
