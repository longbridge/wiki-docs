The Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) rate is an interest rate benchmark used in the United Kingdom. It is the effective overnight interest rate paid by banks for unsecured transactions in the British sterling market. Administered by the Bank of England (BoE), SONIA is used to fund trades that occur overnight during off-hours. As such, it represents the depth of overnight business in the marketplace.
