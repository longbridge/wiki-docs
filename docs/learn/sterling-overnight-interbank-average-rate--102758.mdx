The Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) rate is an interest rate benchmark used in the United Kingdom. It is the effective overnight interest rate paid by banks for unsecured transactions in the British sterling market.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) is a benchmark interest rate used in the United Kingdom. It reflects the effective overnight interest rate paid by banks for unsecured transactions in the sterling market.
