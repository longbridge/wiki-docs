A spot trade, also known as a spot transaction, refers to the purchase or sale of a foreign currency, financial instrument,Â or commodity for instant delivery on a specified spot date. Most spot contracts include the physical delivery of the currency, commodity, or instrument; the difference in the price of a future or forward contract versus a spot contract takes into account the time value of the payment, based on interest rates and the time to maturity. In a foreign exchange spot trade, the exchange rate on which the transaction is based is referred to as the spot exchange rate.A spot trade can be contrasted with a forward or futures trade.
