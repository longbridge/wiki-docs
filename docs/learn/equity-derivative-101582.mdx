An equity derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on the equity movements of the underlying asset. For example, a stock option is an equity derivative, because its value is based on the price movements of the underlying stock.Investors can use equity derivatives to hedge the risk associated with taking long or short positions in stocks, or they can use them to speculate on the price movements of the underlying asset.
