Binomial distribution is a statistical distribution that summarizes the probability that a value will take one of two independent values under a given set of parameters or assumptions.The underlying assumptions of binomial distribution are that there is only one outcome for each trial, each trial has the same probability of success, and each trial is mutually exclusive or independent of one another.
