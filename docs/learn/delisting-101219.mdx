Delisting is the removal of a listed security from a stock exchange.Â The delisting of a security can be voluntary or involuntary and usually results when a company ceases operations, declares bankruptcy, merges, does not meet listing requirements, or seeks to become private.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Delisting refers to the removal of listed securities from a stock exchange. Delisting can be voluntary or involuntary, typically occurring when a company ceases operations, declares bankruptcy, merges, fails to meet listing requirements, or seeks to become a private company.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of delisting emerged with the development of stock exchanges. Early securities markets did not have clear delisting mechanisms, but as markets matured and regulations strengthened, systematic delisting rules were established. In the early 20th century, with the rapid development of securities markets, delisting regulations were gradually improved to protect investors' interests.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Delisting can be divided into voluntary delisting and involuntary delisting.<ul><li><strong>Voluntary Delisting:</strong> A company voluntarily applies to remove its securities from the exchange, usually because it wants to become a private company, reduce regulatory burdens, or because it has been acquired by another company.</li><li><strong>Involuntary Delisting:</strong> The exchange forces the removal of a company's securities based on its rules, usually because the company fails to meet continued listing requirements, such as deteriorating financial conditions, failure to submit financial reports on time, or involvement in significant illegal activities.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company is involuntarily delisted due to three consecutive years of losses, failing to meet the exchange's financial requirements. After delisting, investors can only trade its stock in the over-the-counter market, significantly reducing liquidity.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company is acquired by another company, and the acquirer wishes to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary, thus applying for voluntary delisting. After delisting, the original company's stock is no longer publicly traded, and shareholders can choose to accept cash or stock consideration from the acquirer.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>What happens to the stock after delisting?</strong> After delisting, the stock typically trades in the over-the-counter market, but with lower liquidity and transparency, requiring investors to be cautious.</li><li><strong>How does delisting affect shareholders?</strong> Delisting may lead to reduced stock liquidity, making it difficult for shareholders to quickly liquidate their holdings. Additionally, the company's information disclosure requirements are reduced, making it harder for shareholders to obtain company information.</li></ul></p>`} id={101219} />
