A wide basis is a condition found in futures markets whereby the local cash (spot) price of a commodity is relatively far from its futures price. It is the opposite of a narrow basis, in which the spot price and futures prices are very close together.It is normal for there to be some difference between spot prices and futures prices, due to factors such as transportation and holding costs, interest rates, and uncertain weather. This is known as the basis. However wide, this gap typically converges as the expiration date of the futures contract approaches.
