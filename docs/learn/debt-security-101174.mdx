<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Debt securities are financial instruments that represent a debt owed by the issuer to the holder. Debt securities typically include bonds, notes, and debt certificates. The holder provides funds to the issuer, who in return promises to pay interest at specified future dates and repay the principal at maturity. Debt securities are characterized by fixed returns and lower risk, making them suitable for investors seeking stable income. They are widely used by governments, corporations, and other entities to raise funds.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The history of debt securities can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where governments and merchants raised funds through borrowing.
