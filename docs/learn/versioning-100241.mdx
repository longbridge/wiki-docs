<p>Versioning pricing, also known as versioning strategy, is a marketing strategy where a company offers different versions of the same product or service at different price points to cater to various consumer segments with different needs and willingness to pay. This strategy is commonly used in industries such as software, electronics, and publications. For example, a software company might offer a basic version, a premium version, and an enterprise version, each with varying features and prices. The main objective of versioning pricing is to maximize market coverage and profitability through product differentiation. By offering multiple versions, companies can attract a broader range of consumers and perform price discrimination based on the consumers' needs and willingness to pay, thereby increasing overall revenue.</p>
