Shareholder approval refers to the process in which shareholders vote and approve major matters of the company. According to the provisions of the Company Law and the Articles of Association, certain major matters such as mergers, splits, and issuance of new shares need to be approved by shareholders. Shareholder approval is usually conducted through a shareholders' meeting, where shareholders can vote according to their own wishes and express their support or opposition to the matter. Shareholder approval has a significant influence on the company's decision-making and strategy, and is one of the important mechanisms for protecting shareholder rights and maintaining corporate governance.
