<p>A guaranteed loan is a type of loan in which a third party (typically a government agency, insurance company, or another financial institution) provides a guarantee. This guarantee means that if the borrower is unable to repay the loan, the third party will assume the repayment responsibility. The primary purpose of a guaranteed loan is to reduce the lender's risk, thereby enabling the borrower to obtain more favorable loan terms, such as lower interest rates and longer repayment periods. Guaranteed loans are commonly used in areas like student loans, housing loans, and small business loans.</p>
