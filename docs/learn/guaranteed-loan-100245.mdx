A guaranteed loan is a loan that a third party guarantees—or assumes the debt obligation for—in the event that the borrower defaults. Sometimes, a guaranteed loan is guaranteed by a government agency, which will purchase the debt from the lending financial institution and take on responsibility for the loan.
