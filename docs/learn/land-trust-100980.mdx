A land trust is a legal entity that takes ownership of, or authority over, a piece of property at the request of the property owner. Land trusts are living trusts that allow for the management of property while the owner is alive. However, like other types of trusts, each land trust's terms are unique and can be tailored to individual needs.The main positives of land trusts are that they generally protect landowner anonymity and keep property out of probate. However, these protections aren't always guaranteed, and there is a risk of losing redemption rights and being disqualified from secondary market loans.Land trusts are similar to other trusts but are meant exclusively for real estate. Land trusts can also hold other property-related assets, such as mortgages and notes.Â Any land can be used for a land trust, although they're mostly used for land conservation or developmental property.
