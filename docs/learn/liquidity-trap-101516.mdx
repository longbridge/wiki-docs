<p>A liquidity trap is an adverse economic situation that can occur when consumers and investors hoard cash rather than spending or investing it even when interest rates are low, stymying efforts by economic policymakers to stimulate economic growth.</p><p>The term was first used by economist John Maynard Keynes, who defined a liquidity trap as a condition that can occur when interest rates fall so low that most people prefer to let cash sit rather than put money into bonds and other debt instruments. The effect, Keynes said, is to leave monetary policymakers powerless to stimulate growth by increasing the money supply or lowering the interest rate further.</p><p>A liquidity trap may develop when consumers and investors keep their cash in checking and savings accounts because they believe interest rates will soon rise. That would make bond prices fall, and make them a less attractive option.</p><p>Since Keynes' day, the term has been used more broadly to describe a condition of slow economic growth caused by widespread cash hoarding due to concern about a negative event that may be coming.</p>
