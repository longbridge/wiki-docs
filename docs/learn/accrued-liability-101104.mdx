The term "accrued liability" refers to an expense incurred but not yet paid for by a business. These are costs for goods and services already delivered to a company for which it must pay in the future. A company can accrue liabilities for any number of obligations and are recorded on the company's balance sheet. They are normally listed on the balance sheet as current liabilities and are adjusted at the end of an accounting period.
