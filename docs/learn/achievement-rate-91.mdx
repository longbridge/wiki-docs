Implementation rate refers to the ratio of actual completed goals or plans to expected goals or plans. In the financial field, the implementation rate can represent the difference between actual revenue, profit, or investment return rate and expected revenue, profit, or investment return rate. The higher the implementation rate, the closer or exceeding the actual completed goals to the expected ones.
