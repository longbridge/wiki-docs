The provision for credit losses (PCL) is an estimation of potential losses that a company might experience due to credit risk. The provision for credit losses is treated as an expense on the company's financial statements. They are expected losses from delinquent and bad debt or other credit that is likely to default or become unrecoverable. If, for example, the company calculates that accounts over 90 days past due have a recovery rate of 40%, it will make a provision for credit losses based on 40% of the balance of these accounts.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Credit Reserves</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Credit reserves refer to the estimated potential losses a company might incur due to credit risk. These reserves are considered expenses on the company's financial statements and are used to cover expected losses from defaults, bad debts, or other credit that may not be recoverable.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of credit reserves originated from modern accounting practices, particularly in the early 20th century, as the need to manage credit risk increased with the rise of credit transactions in businesses and financial institutions. Key events include the Great Depression of the 1930s, which prompted companies to pay more attention to credit risk management.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Credit reserves are mainly divided into two categories: specific reserves and general reserves. Specific reserves are estimates of expected losses for particular customers or transactions, while general reserves are estimates of expected losses for the overall credit portfolio based on historical data and statistical models.</p><p>The characteristics of specific reserves include high precision and targeted risk reflection, but they are complex to calculate and require detailed customer information. General reserves are simpler and suitable for large-scale credit portfolios but may lack precision.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A company has an accounts receivable of 1 million yuan, with a portion overdue for more than 90 days. Based on historical data, the company expects a recovery rate of 40% for these overdue accounts. Therefore, the company will set aside a credit reserve of 600,000 yuan for these overdue accounts.</p><p>Case 2: A bank, based on the historical default rate of its credit portfolio and the current economic environment, estimates that the potential credit losses in the next year could be 50 million yuan. The bank will set aside this amount as a credit reserve in its financial statements to cover potential future losses.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why are credit reserves needed?<br/>Credit reserves are needed to manage potential credit risks and ensure that the company's financial statements are more accurate and reliable.</p><p>2. How do credit reserves affect financial statements?<br/>Credit reserves are recorded as expenses in the income statement, reducing the company's net profit but increasing the robustness of the financial statements.</p><p>3. How is the amount of credit reserves determined?<br/>The amount of credit reserves is usually estimated based on historical data, customer credit ratings, and the current economic environment.</p>`} id={101684} />
