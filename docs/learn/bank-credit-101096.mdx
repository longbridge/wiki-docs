In simple terms, bank credit is the total amount of money that a person or business borrows from a bank or other financial institution. The credit limit for the borrower depends on their ability to repay the loan and the total amount of credit the bank can provide.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of bank credit can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where merchants and farmers borrowed to finance trade and agricultural activities. The modern banking credit system developed significantly during the 19th-century industrial revolution, as banks began to systematically offer various types of loans to support industrial and commercial expansion.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Bank credit mainly falls into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Auto Loans:</strong> Used to purchase vehicles, typically with fixed repayment terms and interest rates.</li><li><strong>Personal Loans:</strong> Used for personal expenses such as medical, education, or travel, usually unsecured but with higher interest rates.</li><li><strong>Mortgage Loans:</strong> Used to purchase real estate, with larger loan amounts and longer terms, typically requiring the property as collateral.</li></ul><p>Each type of loan has its own characteristics and applicable scenarios. For example, auto loans and mortgage loans usually have lower interest rates because they are secured by specific assets, while personal loans have higher interest rates due to being unsecured.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Mr. Zhang wants to buy a new car but lacks sufficient funds.
