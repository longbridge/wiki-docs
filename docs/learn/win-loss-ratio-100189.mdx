The win/loss ratio for traders is the total number of winning trades compared to the total number of losing trades in a specific period of time, such as a trading session.It does not take into account how much was won or lost, but simply the number of trades that made money versus the number of trades that lost money.The win/loss ratio is also known as the success ratio.
