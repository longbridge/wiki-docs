An inferior good is an economic term that describes a good whose demand drops when people's incomes rise. These goods fall out of favor as incomes and the economy improve as consumers begin buying more costly substitutes instead.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An inferior good is an economic term used to describe a product whose demand decreases as people's income increases. As income and the economy improve, these goods become less favored, and consumers start purchasing more expensive substitutes.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of inferior goods was first introduced by British economist Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century. He observed that the demand for certain goods had an inverse relationship with income levels, which differed from traditional demand theory.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Inferior goods can be categorized as follows:<ul><li><strong>Basic Necessities:</strong> Such as cheap staple foods (e.g., instant noodles, potatoes), where consumers may opt for higher-end foods as their income increases.</li><li><strong>Low-Cost Substitutes:</strong> Such as public transportation, where consumers may choose to buy private cars as their income rises.</li></ul>These goods are generally characterized by their low price, and consumers tend to choose higher quality or more expensive alternatives as their income increases.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Instant Noodles:</strong> During economic hardships, instant noodles become a primary food source for many households due to their low cost. However, as economic conditions improve, consumers prefer fresh ingredients and high-end foods, leading to a decrease in the demand for instant noodles.</li><li><strong>Public Transportation:</strong> When income is low, many people rely on public transportation. However, as income increases, many opt to purchase private cars, reducing their dependence on public transport.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why does the demand for inferior goods decrease as income increases?</strong> Because consumers tend to purchase higher quality or more expensive substitutes as their income rises.</li><li><strong>Are all low-cost goods considered inferior goods?</strong> No, only those goods whose demand has an inverse relationship with income levels are considered inferior goods.</li></ul></p>`} id={100730} />
