<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>A right-of-use asset refers to a type of right where the holder has the authority to use a specific asset and derive benefits from it without owning the asset itself. Right-of-use assets can include land, buildings, equipment, etc., and holders can use these assets through leasing, franchising, and other methods to gain corresponding returns.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of right-of-use assets emerged with the development of business models like leasing and franchising. In the mid-20th century, as businesses increasingly needed flexible asset management, the concept of right-of-use assets became widely accepted and applied.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Right-of-use assets are mainly divided into two categories: leased assets and franchised assets. Leased assets typically involve equipment, vehicles, or real estate, where the lessee gains usage rights by paying rent. Franchised assets involve the right to use a brand or business model, where the franchisee pays a franchise fee to obtain usage rights. The main features of right-of-use assets are flexibility and cost-effectiveness, allowing businesses to use assets without purchasing them, thus reducing capital expenditure.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A large retail company uses leasing to access commercial real estate in multiple cities, rapidly expanding its market coverage without significant capital investment in property purchases. Case 2: A fast-food chain expands its business through franchising, where franchisees pay a fee to use the brand and business model, lowering the market entry barrier.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face with right-of-use assets include complex lease contract terms and restrictive clauses in franchise agreements. A common misconception is equating right-of-use assets with ownership assets, whereas right-of-use assets only grant usage rights, not ownership.</p>`} id={20} />
