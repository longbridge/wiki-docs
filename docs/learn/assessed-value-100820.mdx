Assessed value is the dollar value assigned to a home or other piece of real estate for property tax purposes. It takes into account the value of comparable properties in the area, among other factors. In many cases, the assessed value is calculated as a percentage of the fair market value of the property.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assessed value refers to the dollar value assigned to a house or other real estate for the purpose of paying property taxes. It takes into account the value of comparable properties in the area, as well as other factors. In many cases, the assessed value is calculated as a percentage of the property's fair market value.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of assessed value originated from the need for governments to levy taxes on real estate. As early as the Middle Ages, governments began assessing land and buildings to determine the amount of tax owed. Over time, assessment methods improved, and the modern system of assessed value gradually took shape in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Assessed value mainly falls into two categories: market assessed value and tax assessed value. Market assessed value is based on market conditions and the sales prices of comparable properties, while tax assessed value is used by the government to calculate property taxes and is usually lower than market assessed value. Characteristics of assessed value include: 1. Influenced by market fluctuations; 2. Determined by professional assessors; 3. May differ from actual sale price.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A residential property in a city has a market value of $500,000 and an assessed value of $400,000, with a tax rate of 1.5%. Therefore, the annual property tax owed by the owner is $400,000 * 1.5% = $6,000. Case 2: A commercial property has a market value of $2,000,000 and an assessed value of $1,500,000, with a tax rate of 2%. Therefore, the annual property tax owed by the owner is $1,500,000 * 2% = $30,000.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why is the assessed value different from the market value? The assessed value is usually lower than the market value because it is the basis for calculating taxes, while the market value is the actual sale price of the property in the market. 2. How can I dispute the assessed value? Property owners can file an appeal with the local tax authority, providing relevant evidence such as recent sales records or independent appraisal reports.</p>`} id={100820} />
