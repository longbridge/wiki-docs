A position trader buys an investment for the long term in the expectation that it will appreciate in value. This type of trader is less concerned with short-term fluctuations in price and the news of the day unless they alter the trader's long term view of the position.Position traders might be seen as the opposite of day traders. They do not trade actively, with most placing fewer than 10 trades in a year.
