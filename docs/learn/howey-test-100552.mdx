The Howey Test is four criteria an asset must meet to qualify as an "investment contract." If the asset is an "investment of money in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others" it is considered a security. It is then subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The test applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction. The Howey Test is important for evaluating blockchain and digital currency projects when developers are fundraising. Certain cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may be found to meet the definition of an "investment contract" under the test.
