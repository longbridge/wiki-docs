A contingent asset is a potential economic benefit that is dependent on some future event(s) largely out of a company’s control. A contingent asset is thus also known as a potential asset.Not knowing for certain whether these gains will materialize, or being able to determine their precise economic value, means these assets cannot be recordedon the balance sheet. However, they can be reported in the accompanying footnotes of financial statements, provided that certain conditions are met.
