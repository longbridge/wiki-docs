<p>Nonfinancial assets refer to assets that do not exist in the form of money or financial instruments. They typically include tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets are physical items like land, buildings, equipment, and inventory, while intangible assets include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. The value of nonfinancial assets is usually determined by their physical properties or utility, rather than their trading value in financial markets.</p>
