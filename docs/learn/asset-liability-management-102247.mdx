Asset/liability management is the process of managing the use of assets and cash flows to reduce the firmâ€™s risk of loss from not paying a liability on time. Well-managed assets and liabilities increase business profits. The asset/liability management process is typically applied to bank loan portfolios and pension plans. It also involves the economic value of equity.
