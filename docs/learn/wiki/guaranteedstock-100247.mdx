The more common reference is to an infrequently used form of common or preferred stock, in which the dividends are guaranteed by one or more other companies. Guaranteed stock issues, like guaranteed bonds, have most often used by railroads and public utilities. The guaranteed dividend can increase the stock's price.The second meaning for guaranteed stock correlates to a company's physical inventory. In this use of the term, guaranteed stock refers to commonly purchased items that a company always keeps a supply of for customers to purchase.
