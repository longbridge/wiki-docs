Weighted Average Remaining Term (WART) is a metric that captures the average time to maturity of a portfolio of asset-backed securities (ABS). The longer the WART, the longer the portfolio's assets will take to mature, on average.Also known as the weighted average maturity (WAM), WART is often used in relation to mortgage-backed securities (MBS) but can also be applied to any portfolio of fixed-income securities.WART is closely related toÂ weighted average loan age (WALA), which is its inverse.
