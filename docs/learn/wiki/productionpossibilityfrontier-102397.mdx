The production possibility frontier (PPF) is a curve on a graph that illustrates the possible quantities that can be produced of two products if both depend upon the same finite resource for their manufacture. The PPF is also referred to as the production possibility curve.PPF also plays a crucial role in economics. For example, it can demonstrate that a nation's economy has reached the highest level of efficiency possible.
