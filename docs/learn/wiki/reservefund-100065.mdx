A reserve fund is a savings account or other highly liquid asset set aside by an individual or business to meet any future costs or financial obligations, especially those arising unexpectedly. If the fund is set up to meet the costs of scheduled upgrades, less liquid assets may be used. For example, a homeowner's association often manages a reserve fund to help maintain the community and its amenities using the dues paid by homeowners.
