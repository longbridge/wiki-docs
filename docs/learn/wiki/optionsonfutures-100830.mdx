An option on a futures contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price on or before the option's expiration date. These work similarly to stock options, but differ in that the underlying security is a futures contract.Most options on futures, such as index options, are cash settled. They also tend to be European-style options, which means that these options cannot be exercised early.
