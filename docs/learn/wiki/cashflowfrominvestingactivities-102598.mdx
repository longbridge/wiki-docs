Cash flow from investing activities (CFI) is one of the sections on the cash flow statement that reports how much cash has been generated or spent from various investment-related activities in a specific period. Investing activities include purchases of physical assets, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets.Negative cash flow is often indicative of a company's poor performance.Â However, negative cash flow from investing activities might be due to significant amounts of cash being invested in the long-term health of the company, such as research and development.
