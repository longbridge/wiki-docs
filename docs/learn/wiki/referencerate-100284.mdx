A reference rate is an interest rate benchmark used to set other interest rates. Various types of transactions use different reference rate benchmarks, but the most common include the Fed Funds Rate, LIBOR, the prime rate, and the rate on benchmark U.S. Treasury securities. Reference rates are useful in homeowner mortgages and sophisticated interest rate swap transactions made by institutions.
