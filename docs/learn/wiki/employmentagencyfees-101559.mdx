The term employment agency fee refers to a fee paid by a company to an employment agency when it successfully places a suitable employee with that employer. Fees tend to vary widely from one agency to another, as they are at the discretion of the agency. There are two types of employment agency feesâ€”employer-paid fees and applicant-paid fees.
