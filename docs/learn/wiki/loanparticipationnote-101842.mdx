A loan participation note (LPN) is a fixed-income security that permits investors to buy portions of an outstanding loan or package of loans. LPN holders participate on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal payments, and are similarly exposed to a proportional risk of default.Banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions often enter into loan participation agreements with local businesses and may offer loan participation notes as a type of short-term investment or bridge financing.
