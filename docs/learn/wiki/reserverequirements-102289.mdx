<p>"Reserve requirements" refer to the portion of deposits that commercial banks are mandated by the central bank to hold as reserves. This measure is intended to ensure the stability and liquidity of the banking system. The reserve requirement ratio, set by the central bank, determines the amount of funds that must be held in reserve. This ratio is adjusted by the central bank based on economic conditions to influence banks' lending capabilities and control the money supply.</p><p>Increasing the reserve requirement ratio means that commercial banks must hold more funds at the central bank, thereby reducing the amount of money available for lending. This can help to cool down an overheating economy and control inflation. Conversely, lowering the reserve requirement ratio can increase banks' lending capacity, stimulating economic growth.</p><p>Reserve requirements are one of the central bank's key monetary policy tools. By adjusting the reserve requirement ratio, the central bank can affect the funding supply within the banking system, thereby influencing the overall economy's liquidity and stability.</p>
