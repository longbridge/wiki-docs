A public company's shares can briefly become a whisper stock if rumors circulate that the company is the target of a takeover offer. The whispers will probably be followed by an immediate surge in trading volume and an increase in its share price.When two companies discuss a merger or an acquisition of one company by the other, the talks are held in the strictest secrecy. An insider who acts on the information in an attempt to make a profit or help someone else make a profit is committing the crime of insider trading.Its price can fall back to Earth just as quickly when the whispers stop, whether they prove to be true or false.
