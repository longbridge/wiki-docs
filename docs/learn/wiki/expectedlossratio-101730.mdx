Expected loss ratio (ELR) method is a technique used to determine the projected amount of claims, relative to earned premiums. The expected loss ratio (ELR) method is used when an insurer lacks the appropriate past claims occurrence data to provide because of changes to its product offerings and when it lacks a large enough sample of data for long-tail product lines.
