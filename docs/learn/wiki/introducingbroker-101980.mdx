An introducing broker (IB) is a broker in the futures markets who has a direct relationship with a client, but delegates the work of the floor operation and trade execution to another futures merchant, typically a futures commission merchant (FCM). The IB is usually affiliated with the FCM, either as an independent entity that is partnered with that merchant firm or as a direct subsidiary of that FCM.
