Decreasing term insurance is a type of renewable term life insurance with coverage decreasing over the life of the policy at a predetermined rate. Premiums are usually constant throughout the contract, and reductions in coverage typically occur monthly or annually. Terms range between 1 year and 30 years depending on the plan offered by the insurance company.Decreasing term life insurance is usually used to guarantee the remaining balance of an amortizing loan, such as a mortgage or business loan over time. It can be contrasted with level-premium term insurance.
