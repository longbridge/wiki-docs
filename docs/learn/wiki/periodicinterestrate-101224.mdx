A periodic interest rate is a rate that can be charged on a loan, or realized on an investment over a specific period of time. Lenders typically quote interest rates on an annual basis, but the interest compounds more frequently than annually in most cases. The periodic interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods.
