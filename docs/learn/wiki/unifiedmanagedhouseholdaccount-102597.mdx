A unified managed household account (UMHA) is a privately managed account that consolidates multiple unaffiliated products including mutual funds, ETFs, and individual securities. The account allows immediate family members, such as parents and children, to access the account. This type of account allows for ease of administration for the financial institution and greater transparency for the investing family.
