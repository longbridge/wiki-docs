The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio that is used to assess a company's financial durability by examining whether it is at least profitable enough to pay off its interest expenses using its pre-tax income. Specifically it looks to see what proportion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), can be used for this purpose.The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is also known simply as as EBITDA coverage. The main difference between EBITDA coverage and the interest coverage ratio, is that the latter uses earnings before income and taxes (EBIT), rather than the more encompassing EBITDA.
