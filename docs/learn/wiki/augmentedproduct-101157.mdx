An augmented product has been enhanced by its seller with added features or services to distinguish it from the same product offered by its competitors. Augmenting a product involves including intangible benefits or add-ons that go beyond the product itself.Examples of the features used to create augmented products might include free delivery or in-home installation of a service. Cosmetics companies tend to offer free makeovers and travel-size samples to augment their products.
