Inflated operating income refers to the act of deliberately exaggerating actual income through improper means or fraudulent behavior. Inflated operating income may include methods such as fictitious sales, false contracts, and inflated accounts receivable, with the aim of presenting the company's financial statements in a better financial condition than the actual situation. Inflated operating income is an illegal act that can mislead investors and stakeholders in judging the company's true operating condition and profitability.
