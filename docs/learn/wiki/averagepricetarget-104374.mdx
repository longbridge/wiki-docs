The average price target is a financial analyst's forecast of the future price of a particular stock or other investment instrument. This target is typically determined based on the analyst's assessment of the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and market conditions. Investors can refer to the average price target to evaluate the potential return and risk of an investment.
