The flat yield curve is a yield curve in which there is little difference between short-term and long-term rates for bonds of the same credit quality. This type of yield curve flattening is often seen during transitions between normal and inverted curves. The difference between a flat yield curve and a normal yield curve is that a normal yield curve slopes upward.
