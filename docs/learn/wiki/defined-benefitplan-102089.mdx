A defined-benefit plan is an employer-sponsored retirement planÂ where employee benefits are computed using a formula that considers several factors, such as length of employment and salary history. The company is responsible for managing the plan's investments and risk and will usually hire an outside investment manager to do this.Typically an employee cannot just withdraw funds as with a 401(k) plan. Rather, they become eligible to take their benefit as a lifetime annuity or in some cases as a lump sum at an age defined by the plan's rules.
