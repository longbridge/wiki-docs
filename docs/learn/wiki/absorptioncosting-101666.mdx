Absorption costing, sometimes called “full costing,” is a managerial accounting method for capturing all costs associated with manufacturing a particular product. All direct and indirect costs, such as direct materials, direct labor, rent, and insurance, are accounted for when using this method.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), U.S. companies may use absorption costing for external reporting, however variable costing is disallowed.
