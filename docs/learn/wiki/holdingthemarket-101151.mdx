"Holding the market" is the deliberate practice of placing active or pending orders for a security in a market where the price is dropping in an attempt to "hold" the price of the security steady or to create an artificial floor in the security. This practice is outlawed in most instances, except when a broker or other party is mandated to keep the price of a security steady; this is only done in rare cases where there isn't enough market depth to hold the price.Holding the market may also refer to the practice of owning a broad market index such as the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000 Total Market.
