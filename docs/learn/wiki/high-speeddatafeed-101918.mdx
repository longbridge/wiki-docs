High-speed data feeds transmit data such as price quotes and yields without delays and are used in high-frequency trading (HFT) for real-time data analysis.These data feeds may be transmitted over fiber optic cable, microwave frequency broadcast, or via co-location at exchange server sites. Since HFT profitability depends on low latency, these and other financial firms have collectively invested billions of dollars in building upgraded high-speed data feeds.
