Cost-push inflation (also known as wage-push inflation) occurs when overallÂ prices increase (inflation) due to increases in the cost of wages and raw materials. Higher costs of production can decrease the aggregate supply (the amount of total production) in the economy. Since the demand for goods hasn't changed, the price increases from production are passed onto consumers creating cost-push inflation.Cost-push inflation can be compared with demand-pull inflation.
