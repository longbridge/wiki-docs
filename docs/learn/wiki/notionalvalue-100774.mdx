Notional value is a term often used by derivatives traders to refer to the total value of the underlying asset in a contract. It can be the total value of aÂ position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract. Put simply, it is the face value that is used to determine payments on a financial asset. This term is used when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, forwards, and currency markets.
