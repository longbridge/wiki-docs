A budget deficit occurs when government expenses exceed revenue. Many people use it as an indicator of the financial health of a country. It is a term more commonly used to refer to government spending and receipts rather than businesses or individuals.Budget deficits affect the national debt, the sum of annual budget deficits, and the cumulative total a country owes to creditors.
