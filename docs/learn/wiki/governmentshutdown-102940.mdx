Government shutdown refers to the inability of the government to pass a budget bill or a resolution for extension, resulting in government departments being unable to receive appropriations and thus unable to operate normally. Government shutdowns usually lead to the suspension of government services, including defense, food inspection, taxation, customs, public transportation, and other departments. Government shutdowns can have a negative impact on the economy and the market.
