An employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is a company-run program in which participating employees can purchase company stock at a discounted price.Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions which build up between the offering date and the purchase date. At the purchase date, the company uses the employee's accumulated funds to purchase stock in the company on behalf of the participating employees.
