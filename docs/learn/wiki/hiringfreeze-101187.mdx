A hiring freeze is when an employer stops hiring workers, usually temporarily, in an effort to contain costs. Such cost-cutting may be the result of financial distress, but even large, successful companies may opt to pause hiring amid an economic slowdown, recession or instances of overcapacity.Hiring freezes may be short-term or long-term, and may help a company avoid laying off employees. Hiring freezes leave unfilled vacancies resulting from firings or natural attrition. In addition, they bar the creation of new positions.
