A press conference is an event organized to officially distribute information and answer questions from the media. Press conferences are also announced in response to specific public relations issues.Corporate press conferences are generally led by the company's executive management, press liaison, or communications officer. Given limited resources, particularly during a time of quarterly or annual earnings, it may be difficult to attract major media attention unless a company has a truly unique or newsworthy announcement to share.Press conferences are held by corporations and other businesses, politicians, and other government officials.
