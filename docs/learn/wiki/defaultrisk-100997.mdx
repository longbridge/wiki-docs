Default risk is the risk a lender takes that a borrower will not make the required payments on a debt obligation, such as a loan, a bond, or a credit card. Lenders and investors are exposed to default risk in virtually all forms of credit offerings. A higher level of default risk typically requires the borrower to pay a higher interest rate.
