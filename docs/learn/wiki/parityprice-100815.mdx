Parity price refers to a price level that sets two assets or securities equal in value to one another. It is a concept that is used in several markets, including fixed income, equities, commodities, and convertible bonds. For convertible bonds, the parity price concept is used to determine when it is financially beneficial to convert a bond into shares of common stock.If two assets are trading at parity, it can be inferred they are at the same price or value.
