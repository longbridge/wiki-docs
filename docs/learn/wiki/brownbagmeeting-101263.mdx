A brown bag meeting is an informal meeting or training that generally occurs in the workplace around lunchtime. This type of meeting is referred to as a brown bag meeting or a brown bag seminar because participants typically bring their lunches, which are associated with being packed in brown paper bags.Meetings of this kind don't necessarily have to occur during the lunch hour and can take place at any time during the workday or after hours. They usually are held in conference rooms.
