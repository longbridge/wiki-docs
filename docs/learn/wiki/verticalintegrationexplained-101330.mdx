Vertical integration is a strategy that allows a company to streamline its operations by taking direct ownership of various stages of its production process rather than relying on external contractors or suppliers. Companies can achieve vertical integration by acquiring or establishing their own suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, or retail locations rather than outsourcing them. Vertical integration can be risky due to the significant initial capital investment required.
