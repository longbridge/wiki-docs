A wild card option is a type of option that is embedded in certain Treasury securities. It permits the seller of a Treasury bond to postpone delivery of its underlying asset until after regular trading hours. This option benefits the seller because it allows them to benefit from a few hours’ extra time in which to secure a favorable price before settling their futures contract.
