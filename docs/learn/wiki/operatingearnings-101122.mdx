Operating earnings is a corporate finance and accounting term that isolates the profits realized from a business's core operations. Specifically, it refers to the amount of profit realized from revenues after you subtract those expenses that are directly associated with running the business, such as the cost of goods sold (COGS), general and administration (G&A) expenses, selling and marketing, research and development, depreciation, and other operating costs.Operating earnings are an important measure of corporate profitability. Because the metric excludes non-operating expenses, such as interest payments and taxes, it enables an assessment of how well the company's chief lines of business are doing.
