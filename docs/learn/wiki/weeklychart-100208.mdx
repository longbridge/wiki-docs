A weekly chart is the data series of price actions for a traded security. On a weekly chart, each candle, bar, or point on a line represents the price summary for a single week of trading. Candlestick charts and bar charts are the most common types of charts used by traders and investors.A weekly chart—set to display in a weekly time frame—will show high, low, open, and close for the entire week but will not show the day-by-day trading movements within that week.Weekly charts can be compared with daily charts.
