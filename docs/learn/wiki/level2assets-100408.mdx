Level 2 assets are financial assets and liabilities that are difficult to value. Although a fair value can be determined based on other data values or market prices, these assets do not have regular market pricing. Level 2 asset values, sometimes called "mark-to-model" assets, can be closely approximated using simple models and extrapolation methods. These methods use known, observable prices as parameters.
