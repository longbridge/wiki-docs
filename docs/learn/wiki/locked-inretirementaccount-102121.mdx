A Locked-in Retirement Account (LIRA) is a type of registered pension account in Canada that does not permit withdrawals before retirement except in exceptional circumstances. Locked-in Retirement Accounts are designed to hold pension funds for former employer-sponsored plan participants and certain others until they reach retirement age.
