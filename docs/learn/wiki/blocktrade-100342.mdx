A block trade is a large, privately negotiated securities transaction.Â Block trades are arranged away from public markets to lessen the effect on the security's price. They are usually carried out by hedge funds and institutional investors via investment banks and other intermediaries, though high-net-worth accredited investors may also be eligible to participate.The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq define a block trade as one involving at least 10,000 shares of stock, or one worth more than $200,000. Most block trades far exceed these minimums.
