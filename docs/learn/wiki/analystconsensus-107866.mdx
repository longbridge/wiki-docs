Analyst consensus refers to the unanimous opinion of analysts in the financial field on the future development and performance of a stock, index, or other financial instrument. Analyst consensus is usually based on research and analysis of relevant data, economic indicators, and company financial conditions. By considering these information comprehensively, analysts form predictions and opinions on future development. The formation of analyst consensus can be used as a reference for investment decisions, but it does not necessarily mean it is accurate or reliable. Investors need to conduct comprehensive analysis by considering other factors when using it.
