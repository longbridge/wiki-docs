The term deadweight loss of taxation refers to the measurement of loss caused by the imposition of a new tax. This results from a new tax that is more than what is normally paid to the government's taxing authority. This theory suggests that imposing a new tax or raising an old one can backfire, resulting in insufficient or no gains in government revenues due to the decline in demand for the goods or services being taxed. A deadweight loss, therefore, disrupts the balance between supply and demand. English economist Alfred Marshall is widely credited as the originator of deadweight loss analysis.
