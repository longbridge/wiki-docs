Cash on delivery (COD) is a type of transaction where the recipient pays for a good at the time of delivery rather than using credit. The terms and accepted forms of payment vary according to the payment provisions of the purchase agreement. Cash on delivery is also referred to as collect on delivery since delivery may allow for cash, check, or electronic payment.
