Call options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right—but not the obligation—to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific period. A call seller must sell the asset if the buyer exercises the call.A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price. The seller profits from the premium if the price drops below the strike price at expiration because the buyer will typically not execute the option.A call option may be contrasted with a put option, which gives the holder the right to sell (force the buyer to purchase) the asset at a specified price on or before expiration.
