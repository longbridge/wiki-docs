The ADP Employment Report is a monthly employment report published by the American human resources management company ADP (Automatic Data Processing). Based on the employment data of a large number of companies managed by ADP, the report provides an estimate of non-farm employment in the US private sector. The ADP Employment Report is usually released before the monthly non-farm employment report from the US Department of Labor and is considered an important economic indicator that can provide predictions and trend analysis of the US labor market.
