The Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol was that industrialized nations needed to lessen the amount of their CO2 emissions. The protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, when greenhouse gases rapidly threatened the climate, life on the earth, and the planet. It was effectively replaced by the Paris Agreement, which went into effect in 2016.
