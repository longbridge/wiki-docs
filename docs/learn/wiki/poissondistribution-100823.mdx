In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that is used to show how many times an event is likely to occur over a specified period. In other words, it is a count distribution. Poisson distributions are often used to understand independent events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time. It was named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.The Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning that the variable can only take specific values in a (potentially infinite) list. Put differently, the variable cannot take all values in any continuous range. For the Poisson distribution, the variable can only take whole number values (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), with no fractions or decimals.
