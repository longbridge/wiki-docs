High-frequency trading (HFT) is a trading method that uses powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. HFT uses complex algorithms to analyze multiple markets and execute orders based on market conditions. Traders with the fastest execution speeds are generally more profitable than those with slower execution speeds. HFT is also characterized by high turnover rates and order-to-trade ratios.
