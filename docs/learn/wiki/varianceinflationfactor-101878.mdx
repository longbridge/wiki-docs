A variance inflation factor (VIF) is a measure of the amount of multicollinearity in regression analysis. Multicollinearity exists when there is a correlation between multiple independent variables in a multiple regression model. This can adversely affect the regression results. Thus, the variance inflation factor can estimate how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity.
