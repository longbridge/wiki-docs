The crowding out effect is an economic theory that argues that rising public sector spending drives down or even eliminates private sector spending.To spend more, the government needs added revenue. It obtains it by raising taxes or by borrowing through the sale of Treasury securities. Higher taxes can mean reduced income and spending by individuals and businesses.Treasury sales can increase interest rates and borrowing costs. That can reduce borrowing demand and spending.All told, these government activities are thought to result in the crowding out of spending by private individuals and companies.
