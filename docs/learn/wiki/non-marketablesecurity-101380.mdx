A non-marketable security is an asset that is difficult to buy or sell due to the fact that they are not traded on any major secondary market exchanges. Such securities, often forms of debt or fixed-income securities, are usually only bought and sold through private transactions or in an over-the-counter (OTC) market.For the holder of a non-marketable security, finding a buyer can be difficult, and some non-marketable securities cannot be resold at all because government regulations prohibit any resale. A non-marketable security may be contrasted with a marketable security, which is listed on an exchange and easily traded.
