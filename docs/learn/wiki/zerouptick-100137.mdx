A zero uptick is a security purchase that is executed at the same price as the trade immediately preceding it, but at a price higher than the transaction before that. For example, if shares trade at $47 a share, and the following two trades transact at $47.03, the last of the two trades at $47.03 is considered to be a zero uptick. This was important for short-sellers trying to avoid shorting a stock on an uptick to comply with the uptick rule (although that rule is no longer in place).
