Key money is a fee paid to a manager, a landlord, or even a current tenant to secure a lease on a residential rental property. The term is sometimes used to refer to a security deposit. However, in some competitive rental markets, key money is simply a gratuity or a bribe.Charging key money may be legal in some cases for commercial real estate agreements as long as it is written into the lease for the property.
