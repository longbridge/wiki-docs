The term interbank deposit refers to an arrangement between two banks in which one holds funds in an account for another institution. The interbank deposit arrangement requires that the holding bank opens a due to account for the other. This is a general ledger account with funds payable to another party. In the arrangement, the correspondent bank is the one that waits for the deposit.
