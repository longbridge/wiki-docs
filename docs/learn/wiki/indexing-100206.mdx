Indexing, broadly, refers to the use of some benchmark indicator or measure as a reference or yardstick. In finance and economics, indexing is used as a statistical measure for tracking economic data such as inflation, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, productivity, and market returns.Indexing may also refer to passive investment strategies that replicate benchmark indexes. Index investing has become increasingly popular over the past decades.
