The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a technical indicator devised to reduce the lag in the results produced by a traditional moving average. Technical traders use it to lessen the amount of "noise" that can distort the movements on a price chart.Like any moving average, the DEMA is used to indicate the trend in the price of a stock or other asset. By tracking its price over time, the trader can spot an uptrend—when the price moves above its average, or a downtrend—when the price moves below its average. When the price crosses the average, it may signal a sustained change in the trend.As its name implies, the DEMA uses two exponential moving averages (EMAs) to eliminate lag in the charts.This variation on the moving average was introduced by Patrick Mulloy in a 1994 article "Smoothing Data With Faster Moving Averages" in magazine.
