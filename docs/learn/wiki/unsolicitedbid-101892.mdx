An unsolicited bid is an offer made by an individual, investor, or company to purchase a company that is not actively seeking a buyer. Unsolicited bids may sometimes be referred to as hostile bids if the target company doesn't want to be acquired. They usually come up when a potential acquirer sees value in the target company.
