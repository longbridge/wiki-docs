The term joint-life payout refers to a payment structure for pensions and retirement plans in which a surviving spouse will continue to receive income after the account holder dies. That contrasts with a single-life payout, for which payments end with the death of the account holder. These two payout options are also known as joint-and-survivor and single-life annuities.
