Darvas box theory is a trading strategy developed by Nicolas Darvas that targets stocks using highs and volume as key indicators.Darvas' trading technique involves buying into stocks that are trading at new highs and drawing a box around the recent highs and lows to establish an entry point and placement of the stop-loss order. A stock is considered to be in a Darvas box when the price action rises above the previous high but falls back to a price not far from that high.
