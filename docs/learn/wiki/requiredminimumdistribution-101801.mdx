A required minimum distribution (RMD) is the amount of money that must be withdrawn annually from an employer-sponsored retirement plan, traditional IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE individual retirement account (IRA) by owners and qualified retirement plan participants of retirement age.In 2022, Congress raised the age at which you must begin taking RMDs. In 2023, that is age 73. Account holders must therefore start withdrawing from a retirement account by April 1, following the year that they reach age 73. The account holder must then withdraw the properly-calculated RMD amount each subsequent year.Another significant change arising from Secure 2.0: Starting in 2024, holders of designated Roth 401(k) accounts will no longer be required to take RMDs. This rule is already true for Roth IRAs.
