A kicker pattern is a two-bar candlestick pattern that predicts a change in the direction of an asset's price trend. This pattern is characterized by a sharp reversal in price over the span of two candlesticks. Traders use it to determine which group of market participants is in control of the direction.The pattern points to a strong change in investors' attitudes toward a security. The change in direction usually occurs following the release of valuable information about a company, industry, or economy.
