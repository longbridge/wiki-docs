Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is a method by which a companyâ€™s value is determined on a per-share basis by measuring its equity without the inclusion of any intangible assets. Intangible assets are those that lack physical substance, thus making their valuation a more difficult undertaking than the valuation of tangible assets.TBVPS is similar to price-to-tangible book value (PTBV).
