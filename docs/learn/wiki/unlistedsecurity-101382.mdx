An unlisted security is a financial instrument that is not traded on a formal exchange because it does not meet listing requirements. Trading of unlisted securities is done on the over-the-counter (OTC) market and they are often called OTC securities. Market makers, or dealers, facilitate the buying and selling of unlisted securities on the OTC market.
