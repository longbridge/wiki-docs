A closed-end fund is a type of mutual fund that issues a fixed number of shares through a single initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital for its initial investments. Its shares can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange but no new shares will be created and no new money will flow into the fund.In contrast, an open-ended fund, such as most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), accepts a constant flow of new investment capital. It issues new shares and buys back its own shares on demand.Many municipal bond funds and some global investment funds are closed-end funds.
