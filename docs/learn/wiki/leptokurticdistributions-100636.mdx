Leptokurtic distributions are statistical distributions with kurtosis greater than three. It can be described as having a wider or flatter shape with fatter tails resulting in a greater chance of extreme positive or negative events.It is one of three major categories found in kurtosis analysis. Its other two counterparts are mesokurtic, which has no kurtosis and is associated with the normal distribution, and platykurtic, which has thinner tails and less kurtosis.
