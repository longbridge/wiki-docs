Bond price refers to the trading price of a bond in the market. The bond price is influenced by various factors, including the bond's maturity date, coupon rate, and market interest rate changes. The bond price has an inverse relationship with the bond's yield. When market interest rates rise, bond prices decrease, and vice versa. The fluctuation of bond prices is of significant importance to bond investors as it can affect investment returns and risks.
