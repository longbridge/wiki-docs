Unadjusted basis refers to the original cost to purchase an asset. This amount includes not only the initial price the purchaser paid to acquire the asset but also includes other costs such as expenses and liabilities assumed to purchase it. Adjusted basis is a related term, and refers to any adjustments made to the original purchase price of an asset over time. Unadjusted basis is used mostly in accounting nomenclature and is akin to the concept of cost basis.
