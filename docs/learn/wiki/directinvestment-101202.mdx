Direct investment is more commonly referred to as foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI refers to an investment in a foreign business enterprise designed to acquire a controlling interest in the enterprise. The direct investment provides capital funding in exchange for an equity interest without the purchase of regular shares of a company's stock.
