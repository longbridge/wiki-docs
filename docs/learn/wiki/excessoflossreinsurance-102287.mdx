Excess of loss reinsurance is a type of reinsurance in which the reinsurer indemnifies–or compensates–the ceding company for losses that exceed a specified limit. A reinsurer is a company that provides financial protection to insurance companies; a ceding company is an insurance company that transfers the insurance portfolio to a reinsurer.Excess of loss reinsurance is a form of non-proportional reinsurance. Non-proportional reinsurance is based on loss retention. With non-proportional reinsurance, the ceding company agrees to accept all losses up a predetermined level.Depending on the language of the contract, excess of loss reinsurance can apply to either all loss events during the policy period or losses in aggregate. Treaties may also use bands of losses that are reduced with each claim.
