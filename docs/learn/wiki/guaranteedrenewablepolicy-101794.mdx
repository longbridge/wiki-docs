A guaranteed renewableÂ policy is an insurance policy feature that ensures that an insurer is obligated to continue coverage as long as premiums are paid on the policy. While re-insurability is guaranteed, premiums can rise based on the filing of a claim, injury, or other factors that could increase the risk of future claims.
