A dividend policy is a policy a company uses to structure its dividend payout. Put simply, a dividend policy outlines how a company will distribute its dividends to its shareholders. These structures detail specifics about payouts, including how often, when, and how much is distributed. There are three different types of dividend policies—stable, constant, and residual—each with its own benefits. Dividend policies aren't mandatory, as some companies choose not to reward shareholders with dividends.
