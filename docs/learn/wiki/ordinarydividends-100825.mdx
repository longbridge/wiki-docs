Ordinary dividends are a share of a company's profits passed on to the shareholders periodically. One of the primary advantages of owning stocks, also known as equities, is the regular payment of dividend income.Dividends are considered "ordinary" by default, although there are cases when a dividend may be classified as "qualified" because it meets specific criteria. Ordinary dividends are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified dividends are taxed at the lower capital gains rate.
