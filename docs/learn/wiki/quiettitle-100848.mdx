Quiet title is a lawsuit filed to establish ownership of real estate when ownership is in question. Real estate owners want to ensure that they have a clear title, meaning that there are no liens or levies against the title and no disputes over the property's ownership. These possible problems are known as clouds on the title and can be resolved by action to quiet the title.Â When you quiet the title, you are insuring that once and for all, there is only one clear owner of the title.
