A qualified opinion is a statement issued in an auditor's report that accompanies a company's audited financial statements. It is an auditor's opinion that suggests the financial information provided by a company was limited in scope or there was a material issue with regard to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)â€”but one that is not pervasive.Qualified opinions may also be issued if a company has inadequate disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements.
