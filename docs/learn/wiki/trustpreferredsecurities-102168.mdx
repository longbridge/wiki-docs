Trust preferred securities (TruPS) were hybrid securities issued by large banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) included in regulatory tier 1 capital and whose dividend payments were tax deductible for the issuer.The bank would open a trust funded with debt; then, the bank would carve up shares of the trust and sold them to investors in the form of preferred stock. The resulting stock was called a trust preferred security or TruPS.First issued in 1996, TruPS became the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny following the 2008-09 financial crisis. As a result of the Dodd-Frank reforms and the Volcker Rule, most of these were phased out at year-end 2015.
