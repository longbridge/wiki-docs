The guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) is a variable annuity rider that guarantees a minimum value to the annuitant after the accumulation period or another set period, usually somewhere close to 10 years. The GMAB rider protects the value of the annuity from market fluctuations. This optional benefit is available for an additional cost, which varies per insurance provider.
