Price to free cash flow (P/FCF) is an equity valuation metric that compares a company's per-share market price to its free cash flow (FCF). This metric is very similar to the valuation metric of price to cash flowÂ but is considered a more exact measure because it uses free cash flow, which subtracts capital expenditures (CAPEX) from a company's total operating cash flow, thereby reflecting the actual cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth.Companies can use this metric to base growth decisions and maintain acceptable free cash flow levels.
