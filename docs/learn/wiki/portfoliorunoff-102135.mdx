Portfolio runoff means assets with a finite term are not replaced as they mature.When the principal invested in a fixed-income security with a set maturity is repaid, the investor must decide whether to reinvest it. When the proceeds from matured bonds are not reinvested, a portfolio can be said to be in runoff.
