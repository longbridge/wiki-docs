A theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is the market price that a stock will theoretically have following a new rights issue. Companies may use a new rights issuance to offer more shares to shareholders, usually at a discounted price. Stock prices are affected by new rights issuance because it increases the number of shares outstanding.
