The Retail Price Index (RPI) is one of two measures of consumer inflation produced by the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS). It measures certain types of cost escalation but is not considered the official inflation statistic in the U.K. The RPI was introduced in 1947 and implemented in 1956.
