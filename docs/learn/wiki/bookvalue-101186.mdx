For value investors, book value is the sum of the amounts of all the line items in the shareholders' equity section on a company's balance sheet. You can also calculate book value by subtracting a business's total liabilities from its total assets.There is also a book value used by accountants to valuate assets owned by a company. This differs from book value for investors because it is used internally for managerial accounting purposes.
