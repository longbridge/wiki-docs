The term funds transfer pricing (FTP) refers to a system that is used to estimate how funding adds to a company's overall profitability. FTP is commonly used in the banking industry to help financial institutions analyze their strengths and failures. FTP may also help companies determine the profitability of various product lines offered, the performance of branch outlets, and judge the effectiveness of processes.
