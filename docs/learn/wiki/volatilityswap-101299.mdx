A volatility swap is a forward contract with a payoff based on the realized volatility of the underlying asset. They settle in cash based on the difference between the realized volatility and the volatility strike or pre-determined fixed volatility level. Volatility swaps allow participants to trade an asset's volatility without directly trading the underlying asset.Volatility swaps are not swaps in the traditional sense, with an exchange of cash flows between counterparties.They are also similar to variance swaps, where the payoff is based on realized variance.
