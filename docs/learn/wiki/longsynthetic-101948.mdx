A synthetic put is an options strategy that combines a short stock position with a long call option on that same stock to mimic a long put option. It's also called a synthetic long put. Essentially, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases an at-the-money call option on that same stock. This action is taken to protect against appreciation in the stock's price.Â A synthetic put is also known as a married call or protective call.
