Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) is a modified return on investment (ROI) figure that takes elements of risk into account. In financial analysis, projects and investments with greater risk levels must be evaluated differently; RAROC thus accounts for changes in an investmentâ€™s profile by discounting risky cash flows against less-risky cash flows.
