The coefficient of determination is a statistical measurement that examines how differences in one variable can be explained by the difference in a second variable when predicting the outcome of a given event. In other words, this coefficient, more commonly known as r-squared (or r), assesses how strong the linear relationship is between two variables and is heavily relied on by investors when conducting trend analysis.This coefficient generally answers the following question: If a stock is listed on an index and experiences price movements, what percentage of its price movement is attributed to the index's price movement?
