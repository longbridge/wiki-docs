Gresham's law is a principle that states that "bad money drives out good" and can be applied to the currency markets.The law stemmed from the historical use of precious metals to manufacture coins and their subsequent value. Since the abandonment of metallic currency standards, the theory often describes the stability and movement of different currencies in global markets.
