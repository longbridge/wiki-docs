Deposit pledge refers to a way of borrowing from banks and other financial institutions by using deposits as collateral. Borrowers provide deposits as collateral to financial institutions as a guarantee for the loan. During the loan period, the borrower's deposits will be frozen until the loan is repaid. Deposit pledge can provide additional loan guarantees, reduce the borrower's credit risk, and also obtain lower loan interest rates.
