Equity accounting is an accounting process for recording investments in associated companies or entities. Companies sometimes have ownership interests in other companies. Typically, equity accounting–also called the equity method–is applied when an investor or holding entity owns 20–50% of the voting stock of the associate company. The equity method of accounting is used only when an investor or investing company can exert a significant influence over the investee or owned company.
