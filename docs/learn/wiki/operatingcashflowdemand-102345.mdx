The term operating cash flow demand (OCFD) refers to the amount of operating cash flow an entity needs in order to meet the objectives of its strategic investments. An OCFD is integral for both investors and corporate entities. For investors, it represents the total amount of capital required in order to the desired return over the entire life of the investment. A company's OCFD, on the other hand,Â is used to compute the cash value added to a company's strategic investments and operations. The OCFD allows entities to make smart decisions about how they spend their money on certain investments.
