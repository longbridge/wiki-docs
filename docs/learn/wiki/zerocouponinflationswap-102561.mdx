A zero-coupon inflation swap (ZCIS) is a type of derivative in which a fixed-rate payment on a notional amount is exchanged for a payment at the rate of inflation. It is an exchange of cash flows that allows investors to either reduce or increase their exposure to the changes in the purchasing power of money.A ZCIS is sometimes known as a breakeven inflation swap.
