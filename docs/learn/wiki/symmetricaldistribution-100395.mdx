A symmetrical distribution occurs when the values of variables appear at regular frequencies and often the mean, median, and mode all occur at the same point. If a line were drawn dissecting the middle of the graph, it would reveal two sides that mirror one other.In graphical form, symmetrical distributions may appear as a normal distribution (i.e., bell curve). Symmetrical distribution is a core concept in technical trading as the price action of an asset is assumed to fit a symmetrical distribution curve over time.Symmetrical distributions can be contrasted with asymmetrical distributions, which is a probability distribution that exhibits skewness or other irregularities in its shape.
