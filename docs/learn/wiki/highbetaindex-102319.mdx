A high beta index is a basket of stocks that exhibits greater volatility than a broadÂ market index such as the S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 High Beta Index is the most well-known of these indexes. It tracks the performance of 100 companies in the S&P 500 that are the most sensitive to changes in market returns.
