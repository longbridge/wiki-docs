Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the value of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as copyrights, patents, and intellectual property.For an individual, the tangible net worth calculation includes home equity, any other real estate holdings, bank and investment accounts, and major personal assets such as an automobile or jewelry. Relatively insignificant personal assets are not ordinarily included in the calculation for an individual.
