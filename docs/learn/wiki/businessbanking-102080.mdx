Business banking is a company's financial dealings with an institution that provides business loans, credit, savings accounts, and checking accounts, specifically designed for companies rather than for individuals.Business banking occurs when a bank, or division of a bank, only deals with businesses. A bank that deals mainly with individuals is generally called a retail bank, while a bank that deals with capital markets is known as an investment bank. There are some banks that deal with both types of clients.
