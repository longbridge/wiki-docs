The market risk premium (MRP) is the difference between the expected return on a market portfolio and the risk-free rate.The market risk premium is equal to the slope of the security market line (SML), a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). CAPM measures the required rate of return on equity investments, and it is an important element of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and discounted cash flows (DCF) valuation.
