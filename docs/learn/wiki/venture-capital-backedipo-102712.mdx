The term venture capital-backed IPO refers to the initial public offering of a company that was previously financed by private investors. These offerings are considered a strategic plan by venture capitalists to recover their investments in the company. Investors normally wait for an opportune time to issue this type of initial public offering in order to maximize their return on investment (ROI).
