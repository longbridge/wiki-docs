Warrant coverage is an agreement between a company and one or more shareholders where the company issues aÂ warrant equal to some percentage of the dollar amount of an investment. Warrants, similar to options, allow investors to acquire shares at a designated price.Warrant coverage agreements are designed to sweeten the deal for an investor because the agreement leverages their investment and increases their return if the value of the company increases as hoped.
