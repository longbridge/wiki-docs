The average cost basis method is a system of calculating the value of mutual fundÂ positions held in a taxable account to determine the profit or loss for tax reporting. Cost basis represents the initial value of a security or mutual fund that an investor owns.The average cost is then compared with the price at which the fund shares were sold to determine the gains or losses for tax reporting.
