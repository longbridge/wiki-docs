A turnkey solution is a type of system built end-to-end for a customer that can be easily implemented into a current business process. It is immediately ready to use upon implementation and is designed to fulfill a certain process such as manufacturing (in part or whole), billing, website design, training, or content management.A turnkey solution system is different than a custom-built or designed system. When a company or business isn't looking for multiple bells and whistles, a turnkey solution may be an affordable and simple option.In a turnkey solution, a corporate buyer just has to "turn" a "key" to commence a business activity in the newly built structure. "Solution" evolved in the turnkey concept as economies became more service-based.A possible drawback of this method, as opposed to designing a process in-house or a custom-built system, is that specifications that are important to a particular company may not be sufficiently integrated into the solution. In-house or custom-built versus turnkey decisions take the complexity of a business process into consideration.
