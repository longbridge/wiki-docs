The hedge ratio compares the value of a position protected through the use of a hedge with the size of the entire position itself. A hedge ratio may also be a comparison of the value of futures contracts purchased or sold to the value of the cash commodity being hedged.Futures contracts are essentially investment vehicles that let the investor lock in a price for a physical asset at some point in the future.
