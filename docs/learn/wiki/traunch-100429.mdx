A traunch is one of a series of payments to be paid out over a specified period, subject to certain performance metrics being achieved. It is commonly used in venture capital (VC) circles to refer to the fundraising rounds used to fund startup companies.The term "traunch" is based on the French word "tranche," meaning "slice." The term tranche is also used in the context of securitization, as with mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
