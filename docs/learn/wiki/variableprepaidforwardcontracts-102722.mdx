A variable prepaid forward contract is a strategy used by stockholders to cash in some or all of their shares while deferring the taxes owed on the capital gains. The sale agreement is not immediately finalized but the stockholder collects the money.This strategy is typically used by investors who own a large number of shares in a single company and want to raise cash while postponing taxes.
