The term "loan syndication" refers to the process of involving a group of lenders that fund various portions of a loan for a single borrower. Loan syndication most often occurs when a borrower requires an amount that is too large for a single lender or when the loan is outside the scope of a lender's risk exposure levels. Multiple lenders pool together and form a syndicate to provide the borrower with the requested capital.
