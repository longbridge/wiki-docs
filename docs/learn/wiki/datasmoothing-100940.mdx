Data smoothing is done by using an algorithm to remove noise from a data set. This allows important patterns to more clearly stand out.Data smoothing can be used to help predict trends, such as those found in securities prices, as well as in economic analysis. Data smoothing is intended to ignore one-time outliers and take into account the effects of seasonality.
