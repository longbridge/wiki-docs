A qualified retirement plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that meets the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), making it eligible for certain tax benefits. These can include tax deductions for employer and employee contributions and tax deferral of investment gains.
