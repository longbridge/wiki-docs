Treatment for sickle cell disease refers to the therapy used to treat sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by an abnormal shape of red blood cells that resemble a sickle. The goal of sickle cell disease treatment is to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and extend the patient's life. Common methods of sickle cell disease treatment include blood transfusions, anti-malaria drugs, pain management, and antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections.
