Tangible common equity (TCE) is a measure of a company's physical capital, which is used to evaluate a financial institution's ability to deal with potential losses. It is often used when analyzing financial firms that do not normally have a relatively large amount of tangible assets.Tangible common equity is calculated by subtracting intangible assets (including goodwill)Â and preferred equity from the company's book value.
