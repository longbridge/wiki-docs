Key rate duration measures how the value of a debt security or a debt instrument portfolio, generally bonds,Â changes at a specific maturity point along the entirety of the yield curve. When keeping other maturities constant, the key rate duration is used to measure the sensitivity in a debt security's price to a 1% change in yield for a specific maturity.
