The dividend rate is the total expected dividend payments from an investment, fund, or portfolio expressed on an annualized basis plus any additional non-recurring dividends that an investor may receive during that period. Depending on the company's preferences and strategy, the dividend rate can be fixed or adjustable.The dividend rate is closely related to dividend yield and is sometimes used interchangeably.
