The law of supply is a microeconomic law. It states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of that good or service that suppliers offer will increase, and vice versa.In plain terms, this law means that as the price of an item goes up, suppliers will attempt to maximize their profits by increasing the number of that item that they sell.
