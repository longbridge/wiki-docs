Appropriation is the act of setting aside money for a specific purpose. In accounting, it refers to a breakdown of how a firmâ€™s profits are divided up, or for the government, an account that shows the funds a government department has been credited with. A company or a government appropriates funds in order to delegate cash for the necessities of its business operations.
