Lindahl equilibrium is a state of equilibrium in a quasi-market for the pure public good. As in competitive market equilibrium, the supply and demand for the good are balanced, in addition to the cost and revenue to produce the good. Lindahl equilibrium depends on the possibility of implementing an effective Lindahl tax, first proposed by the Swedish economist Erik Lindahl.
