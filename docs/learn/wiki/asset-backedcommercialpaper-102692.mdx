An asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) is a short-term investment vehicle with a maturity date that is typically between 90 and 270 days. A bank or other financial institution typically issues the security itself. The notes are backed by the company's physical assets such as trade receivables. Companies will use an asset-backed commercial paper to fund short-term financing needs.
