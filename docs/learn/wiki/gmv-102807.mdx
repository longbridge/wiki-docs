<p>ross Merchandise Volume (GMV) refers to the total transaction amount over a period of time.<br>GMV = Sales + Cancelled Order Amount + Rejected Order Amount + Returned Order Amount.<br>GMV is not actual transaction data, but can be used for reference purposes. As long as the customer takes a purchase action, it will be counted in GMV whether the purchase is actually made or not. It can be used to research customer purchase intent. E-commerce platforms like JD.com and Taobao generally use GMV, which has better timeliness than other metrics.</p>
