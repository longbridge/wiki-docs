Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured from either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises andÂ falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a volatile market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.
