Random walk theory suggests that changes in asset prices are random. This means that stock prices move unpredictably, so that past prices cannot be used to accurately predict future prices. Random walk theory also implies that the stock market is efficient and reflects all available information.A random walk challenges the idea that traders can time the market or use technical analysis to identify and profit from patterns or trends in stock prices. Random walk has been criticized by some traders and analysts who believe that stock prices can be predicted using various methods, like technical analysis.
