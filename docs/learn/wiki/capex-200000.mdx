<p>Capital Expenditure (Capex) refers to the funds a company spends on acquiring, maintaining, or improving its fixed assets, such as buildings, machinery, equipment, or technology. These expenditures are considered investments in the long-term growth and productive capacity of the business.&nbsp;</p><p>Capex is typically categorized as a capital budget item, which is a significant purchase that contributes to the company's value over time. It is distinct from operational expenses, which cover the ongoing costs of running a business, such as salaries, rent, and utilities. Capex is often used to expand a company's capabilities, modernize its facilities, or increase its production capacity.</p>
