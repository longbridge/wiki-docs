A fixed annuity is a type of insurance contract that promises to pay the buyer a specific, guaranteed interest rate on their contributions to the account. By contrast, a variable annuity pays interest that can fluctuate based on the performance of an investment portfolio chosen by the account's owner. Fixed annuities are often used in retirement planning.
