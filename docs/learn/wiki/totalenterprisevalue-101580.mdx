Total enterprise value (TEV) is a valuation measurement used to compare companies with varying levels of debt. It includes not only a company's equity value but also the market value of its debt while subtracting out cash and cash equivalents.TEV is considered a more comprehensive alternative to market capitalization and is commonly used to calculate the cost of a target company in a takeover.
