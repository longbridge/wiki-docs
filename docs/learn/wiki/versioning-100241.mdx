Versioning (alsoÂ known as "quality discrimination") is a business practice in which a company produces different models of essentially the same product and then charges different prices for each model. Versioning a product gives the consumer the option of purchasing a higher valued model for more money or a lower-valued model for less money. In this way, the business is attempting to attract higher prices based on the value a customer perceives.
