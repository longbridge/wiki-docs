The term Vasicek Interest Rate Model refers to a mathematical method of modeling the movement and evolution of interest rates. It is a single-factor short-rate model that is based on market risk. The Vasicek interest model is commonly used in economics to determine where interest rates will move in the future. Put simply, it estimates where interest rates will move in a given period of time and can be used to help analysts and investors figure out how the economy and investments will fare in the future.
