A best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) is a course of action that a party engaged in negotiations has determined should be taken if talks fail and no agreement can be reached.Negotiation researchers Roger Fisher and William Ury coined the term BATNA in their 1981 bestseller, "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In."A party's BATNA is the position it will fall back on if negotiation proves unsuccessful.
