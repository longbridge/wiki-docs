A brokerage account is an investment account held at a licensed brokerage firm. An investor deposits funds into their brokerage account and the brokerage firm transacts orders for investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) on their behalf.The assets in investment accounts belong to the investors, who normally must report as taxable the income derived from the account.
