Price sensitivity is the degree to which the price of a product affects consumers' purchasing behaviors. Generally speaking, it's how demand changes with the change in the cost of products.In economics, price sensitivity is commonly measured using the price elasticity of demand, or the measure of the change in demand based on its price change. For example, some consumers are not willing to pay a few extra cents per gallon for gasoline, especially if a lower-priced station is nearby.When companies and product manufacturers study and analyze price sensitivity, they can make sound decisions about products and services.
