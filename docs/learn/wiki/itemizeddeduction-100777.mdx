An itemized deduction is an expense that can be subtracted from your adjusted gross income (AGI) to reduce your taxable income and lower the amount of taxes you owe. Taxpayers can itemize deductions like mortgage interest, charitable gifts, and unreimbursed medical expenses or choose to take the standard deduction, a fixed dollar amount that varies by filing status.
