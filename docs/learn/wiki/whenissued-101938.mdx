When issued (WI) is a transaction that is made conditionally because a security has been authorized but not yet issued. Treasury securities, stock splits, and new issues of stocks and bonds are all traded on a when-issued basis.Prior to a new issue's offering, underwriters solicit potential investors who may elect to book an order to purchase a portion of the new issue.
