A credit rating is an independent assessment of a company's or government entity's creditworthiness in general terms or with respect to a particular debt or financial obligation. Credit ratings are issued by organizations such as S&P Global,Â Moody's, or Fitch Ratings. They differ from credit scores, which are assigned to individuals.
