A white candlestick depicts a period where the security's price has closed at a higher level than where it had opened. It is a point on a security's candlestick chart representing a bullish period.On some charts, an up-candlestick may be depicted as either green or black. These may be contrasted with a red candlestick, which denotes a lower closing price than the prior period.
