Deducting non-recurring gains and losses from net profit refers to the net profit obtained by excluding non-recurring gains and losses items when calculating net profit. Non-recurring gains and losses refer to income or expenses that are not related to normal business activities or occur infrequently, such as gains or losses from disposal of assets, non-recurring government subsidies, etc. Deducting non-recurring gains and losses from net profit can better reflect a company's operating conditions and profitability.
