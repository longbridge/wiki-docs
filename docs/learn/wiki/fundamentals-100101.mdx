Fundamentals include the basic qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to the financial or economic well-being of a company, security,Â or currency, and their subsequent financial valuation. Where qualitative information includes elements that cannot be directly measured, such as management experience, quantitative analysis (QA) uses mathematics and statistics to understand the asset and predict its movements.
