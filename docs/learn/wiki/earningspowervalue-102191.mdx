Earnings power value (EPV) is a technique for valuing stocks by making assumptions about the sustainability of current earnings and the cost of capital but not future growth. Earnings power value (EPV) is derived by dividing a company's adjusted earnings by its weighted average cost of capital (WACC).While the formula is simple, there are a number of steps that need to be taken to calculate adjusted earnings and WACC. The final result is "EPV equity," which can be compared to market capitalization.
