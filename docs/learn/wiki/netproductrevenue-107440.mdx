Net product income refers to the income obtained by a company after deducting the costs and expenses directly related to the sale of products. This includes the sales price of the product minus the costs directly related to the sale of the product, such as production costs, sales expenses, and distribution expenses. Net product income is one of the main sources of a company's operating activities and can be used to assess the company's sales and profitability.
