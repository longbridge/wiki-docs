A zero capital gains rate implies a tax rate of 0% on capital gains. This 0% rate may be charged to individuals who sell property within a so-called "enterprise zone." Such a zone is a geographic area that has been granted special tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, or other public assistance in order to encourage private economic development and job creation. They are used most often to promote the revitalization of a city neighborhood.The zero capital gains rate can be applied by a given level of government in order to prompt investment in a given area.
