A bespoke CDO is a structured financial product—specifically, a collateralized debt obligation (CDO)—that a dealer creates for a specific group of investors and tailors to their needs. The investor group typically buys a single tranche of the bespoke CDO, and the remaining tranches are then held by the dealer, who will usually attempt to hedge against potential losses using other financial products like credit derivatives.A bespoke CDO is now more commonly referred to as a bespoke tranche or a bespoke tranche opportunity (BTO).
