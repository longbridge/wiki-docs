A qualified institutional buyer (QIB) is a class of investor that can safely be assumed to be a sophisticated investor and hence does not require the regulatory protection that the Securities Act's registration provisions give to investors. In broad terms, QIBs are institutional investors that own or manage on a discretionary basis at least $100 million worth of securities.The SEC allows only QIBs to trade Rule 144A securities, which are certain securities deemed to be restricted or control securities, such as private placement securities for example.
