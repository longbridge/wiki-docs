The term "General Agreements to Borrow" (GAB) refers to a terminated lending medium for members of the Group of Ten (G-10). The program was established in 1962, allowing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to borrow funds from the central banks of these advanced countries. The capital was advanced as temporary loans to countries experiencing economic distress so they could avoid crisis situations. The GAB was phased out at the end of 2018 after member countries agreed its usefulness was "diminished and limited."
