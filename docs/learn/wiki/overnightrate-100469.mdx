The overnight rate is theÂ interest rate at which a depository institution (generally banks) lends or borrows funds from another depository institution in the overnight market. In many countries, the overnight rate is the interest rate the central bank sets to target monetary policy. In most circumstances, the overnight rate is the lowest available interest rate, and as such, it is only available to the most creditworthy institutions.
