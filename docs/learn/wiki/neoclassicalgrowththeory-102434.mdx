Neoclassical growth theory is an economic theory that outlines how a steady economic growth rate results from a combination of three driving forcesâ€”labor, capital, and technology. The National Bureau of Economic Research names Robert Solow and Trevor Swan as having the credit of developing and introducing the model of long-run economic growth in 1956. The model first considered exogenous population increases to set the growth rate but, in 1957, Solow incorporated technology change into the model.
