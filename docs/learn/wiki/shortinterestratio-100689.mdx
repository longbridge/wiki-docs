The short Interest ratio takes the number of shares held short in a stock and it divides this by the stock's average daily trading volume. Simply put, the ratio can help an investor find out very quickly if a stock is heavily shorted or not shorted versus its average daily trading volume.The term is sometimes used interchangeably with days to cover.
