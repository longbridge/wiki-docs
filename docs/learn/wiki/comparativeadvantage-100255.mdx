Comparative advantage is an economy's ability to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners. Comparative advantage is used to explain why companies, countries, or individuals can benefit from trade.When used to describe international trade, comparative advantage refers to the products that a country can produce more cheaply or easily than other countries. While this usually illustrates the benefits of trade, some contemporary economists now acknowledge that focusing only on comparative advantages can result in the exploitation and depletion of the country's resources.The law of comparative advantage is popularly attributed to English political economist David Ricardo and his book  written in 1817, although it is likely that Ricardo's mentor, James Mill, originated the analysis.
