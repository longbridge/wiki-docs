A quality control chart is a graphic that depicts whether sampled products or processes are meeting their intended specifications. If not, the chart will show the degree by which they vary from specifications. A quality control chart that analyzes a specific attribute of a product is called a univariate chart, while a chart measuring variances in several product attributes is called a multivariate chart. Randomly selected products are tested for the given attribute(s) the chart is tracking.
