Guaranteed investment income is a type of investment product offered by insurance companies that allow clients to invest in equity, bond, and/or index fund while providing a promise of a predefined minimum value of the fund (usually, the initial investment amount) will be available at the fund's maturity or when the client dies.Insurance companies typically charge up to 1% of the investment amount per year for this service.
