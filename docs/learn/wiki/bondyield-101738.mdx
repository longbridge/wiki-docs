A bond yield is the return an investor realizes on a bond. Put simply, a bond yield is the return on the capital invested by an investor. Bond yields are different from bond pricesâ€”both of which share an inverse relationship. The yield matches the bond's coupon rate when the bond is issued. Bond yields can be derived in different ways, including the coupon yield and current yield. Additional calculations of a bond's yield include yield to maturity (YTM) among others.
