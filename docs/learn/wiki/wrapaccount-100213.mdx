A wrap account is an investment portfolio that is professionally managed by a brokerage firm for a flat fee that is charged quarterly or annually. The fee is based on total assets under managementÂ (AUM). It is comprehensive, covering all administrative, commission, and management expenses for the account.Wrap fees range from about 1% to 3% of AUM.For many investors, a wrap account proves to be less expensive over time than a brokerage account that charges commissions for trading activity. However, the buy-and-hold investor who rarely sells holdings might be better off with a commission-based fee structure.
