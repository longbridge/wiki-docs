Debt service refers to the money required to cover the payment of interest and principal on a loan or otherdebt for a particular time period. The term can apply both to individual debts, such as a home mortgage or student loan, and corporate or government debt, such as business loans and debt-based securities such as bonds.The ability to service debt is a key factor when a person applies for a loan or a company needs to raise additional capital to operate its business. To “service a debt” means to make the necessary payments on it.
