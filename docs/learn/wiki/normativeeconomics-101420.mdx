Normative economics is a perspective on economics that reflects normative, or ideologically prescriptive judgments toward economic development, investment projects, statements,Â and scenarios.Unlike positive economics, which relies on objective data analysis, normative economics is concerned with value judgments and statements of what "ought" to be. It expresses ideological judgments about what may result in economic activity if public policy changes are made. Normative economic statements can't be verified or tested.
