A hybrid annuity is a retirement income investment that allows investors to split their funds between fixed-rate and variable-rate components. Investors can divide their savings between conservative assets that offer a low but guaranteed rate of return and riskier assets that offer the potential for higher returns. As in any annuity, the goal is to create a steady stream of income during retirement.
