A financing lease agreement refers to an agreement in which the lessor provides funds to the lessee to purchase leased equipment or assets and leases them to the lessee. In a financing lease agreement, the lessor leases the equipment or assets to the lessee for a period of time and collects rent as a return. Financing lease agreements usually have fixed rental payment terms and conditions, as well as provisions on whether the lessee has the right to purchase the leased equipment or assets after the lease term expires. Financing lease agreements can help businesses obtain the equipment or assets they need while sharing the cost and risk.
