A purchase annual percentage rate (APR) is the interest rate that your credit card issuer will charge you on purchases when you carry a balance on your card. In addition to purchase APRs, credit cards can have different APRs for cash advances and balance transfers. They may also have introductory APRs for a certain period after you sign up and penalty APRs for missing payments.
