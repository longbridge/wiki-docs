A non-cash item has two different meanings. In banking, the term is used to describe a negotiable instrument, such as a check or bank draft, that is deposited but cannot be credited until it clears the issuer's account.Alternatively, in accounting, a non-cash item refers to an expense listed on an income statement, such as capital depreciation, investment gains, or losses, that does not involve a cash payment.
