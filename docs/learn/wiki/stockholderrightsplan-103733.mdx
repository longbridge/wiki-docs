The shareholder equity plan is a company's anti-takeover measure designed to protect the company from hostile takeovers by potential acquirers. The plan usually includes the issuance of new shares or stock purchase rights, or gives existing shareholders the right of first refusal to purchase new shares. This plan can make potential acquirers face higher costs or make it more difficult to gain control.
