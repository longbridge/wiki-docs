Back-to-back letters of credit are two letters of credit (LoCs) used together to finance a transaction. These are used primarily in international transactions. The first letter of credit serves as collateral for the second letter of credit. Back-to-back letters of credit are usually used in a transaction involving an intermediary between the buyer and seller, such as a broker.
