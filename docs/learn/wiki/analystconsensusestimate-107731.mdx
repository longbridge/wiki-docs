Analyst consensus estimate refers to a method in which analysts make predictions and estimates of future performance and financial indicators of a specific company or industry based on their own research and analysis. Analyst consensus estimates can include forecasts of a company's revenue, profit, market share, sales growth rate, and other aspects.
