The term “universal default” refers to a provision found in some credit cards’ cardholder agreements. According to this provision, the credit card company is permitted to increase the interest rate on the credit card if the cardholder fails to make their minimum monthly payment.Importantly, credit card companies can also increase the customer’s interest rate if their customer defaulted on a separate credit product, such as a car loan or a mortgage, even if that other loan was extended by an unrelated lender.
