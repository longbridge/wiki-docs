The term leasehold improvement refers to any changes made to customize a rental property to satisfy the particular needs of a specific tenant. These changes and alterations may include painting, installing partitions, changing the flooring,Â or putting in customized light fixtures. Improvements may be undertaken by the landlord or the tenant and may be paid by the tenant.While the useful economic life of most leasehold improvements is anywhere between five and 10 years, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires that depreciation for such improvements to occur over the economic life of the building.
