A joint bond is sold with a guarantee of the payment of principal and interest by at least two parties. In the case of default by the issuer, the bondholders have the right to claim repayment by any and all of the issuing institutions, corporations, or individuals. ThisÂ shared responsibility reduces the risk to the investor but also generally means a lower rate of return on the investment.
