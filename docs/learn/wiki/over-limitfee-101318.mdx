An over-limit fee is a penalty charged by credit card companies when cardholders’ purchases exceed their credit limit. Previously, credit card companies would decline the transaction if the consumer made a purchase over their limit; however, credit card companies moved to a practice of allowing the transaction to go through but charging a fee. This practice has stopped since the passing of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act in 2009.
