Operational efficiency is primarily a metric that measures the efficiency of profit earned as a function of operating costs.Â The greater the operational efficiency, the more profitable a firm or investment is. This is because the entity is able to generate greater income or returns for the same or lower cost than an alternative.In financial markets, operational efficiency occurs when transaction costs and fees are reduced. An operationally efficient market may also be known as an "internally efficient market."
