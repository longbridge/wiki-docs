A non-issuer transaction is a transaction involving a security that is not directly or indirectly executed for the benefit of the issuing company. Most deals that occur on the secondary market, such as stock exchanges, involve non-issuer transactions; secondary offerings; or share buybacks that will involve the issuer.
