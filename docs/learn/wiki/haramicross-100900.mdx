A harami cross is a Japanese candlestick pattern that consists of a large candlestick that moves in the direction of the trend, followed by a small doji candlestick. The doji is contained within the prior candlestickâ€™s body. The harami cross pattern suggests that the previous trend may be about to reverse. The pattern can be either bullish or bearish. The bullish pattern signals a possible price reversal to the upside, while the bearish pattern signals a possible price reversal to the downside.
