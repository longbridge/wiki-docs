Financing inflow refers to the capital inflow into a company or institution through the issuance of securities such as stocks and bonds, or through obtaining loans from banks and other financial institutions. Financing inflow can help companies or institutions expand their scale and enhance their competitiveness, but at the same time, it also brings certain financial risks and debt pressures.
