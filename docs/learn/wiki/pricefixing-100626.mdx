Fixing is the practice of setting the price of a product rather than allowing it to be determined by free-market forces. Fixing a price is illegal if it involves collusion among producers or suppliers.While fixing almost always refers to price-fixing, it may also apply to other related contexts. For example, the supply of a product can be fixed in order to maintain its price level or push it higher.
