The U.S. Treasury yield curve refers to the relationship between the yields of U.S. government bonds with different maturities. It is often seen as a leading indicator of economic recession. If the yield on long-term bonds is lower than the yield on short-term bonds, it suggests that the market predicts future economic downturn.
