A prepaid debit card is much like a gift card: It allows you to spend whatever amount of money is stored on the card. You can reload the card online or at an ATM, a participating store, or another physical location when the balance is used up. Prepaid debit cards are issued by banks and they're branded by the major credit card companies, including Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
