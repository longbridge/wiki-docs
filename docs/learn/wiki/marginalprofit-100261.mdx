Marginal profit is the profit earned by a firm or individual when one additional or marginal unit is produced and sold. Marginal refers to the added cost or profit earned with producing the next unit. Marginal product is the additional revenue earned while the marginal cost is the added cost for producing one additional unit.Marginal profit is the difference between marginal cost and marginal product (also known as marginal revenue). Marginal profit analysis is useful for managers because it aids in deciding whether to expand production or to slow down stop production altogether, a moment known as a shutdown point.Under mainstream economic theory, a company will maximize its overall profits when marginal cost equals marginal revenue, or when marginal profit is exactly zero.
