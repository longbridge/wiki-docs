Good delivery refers to the unhindered transfer of ownership of a security from a seller to a buyer, with all necessary requirements having been met. This used to be a rather complex process, although nowadays, thanks to electronic exchanges that facilitate the digital transfer and clearing of many securities, good delivery has become automated and generally much more straightforward.
