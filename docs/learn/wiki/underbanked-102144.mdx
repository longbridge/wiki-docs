Underbanked refers to individuals or families who have a bank account but often rely on alternative financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans rather than on traditional loans and credit cards to manage their finances and fund purchases. This may be because they lack access to convenient, affordable banking services or because they need or prefer to use alternatives to traditional financial services.
