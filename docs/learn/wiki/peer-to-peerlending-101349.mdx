Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as the middleman. Websites that facilitate P2P lending have greatly increased their adoption as an alternative method of financing.P2P lending is also known as “social lending” or “crowd lending.” It has only been around since 2005, but the crowd of competitors already includes Prosper, Lending Club, Upstart, and Funding Circle.
