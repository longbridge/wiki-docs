Generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) are a set of systematic guidelines used by auditors when conducting audits of companies' financial records. GAAS helps to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and verifiability of auditors' actions and reports. The Auditing Standards Board (ASB) of theÂ American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) created GAAS. Its members agree to adhere to the standards.
