Liquidity risk is the risk that a company or individual will not have enough cash to meet its financial obligations (pay its debts) on time. Liquidity refers to the ease at which an asset can be converted into cash without negatively affecting its market price; the risk arises when a company cannot buy or sell an investment in exchange for cash fast enough to pay its debts.
