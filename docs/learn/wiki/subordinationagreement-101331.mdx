A subordination agreement is a legal document that establishes one debt as ranking behind another in priority for collecting repayment from a debtor. The priority of debts can become extremely important when a debtor defaults on their payments or declares bankruptcy. The higher a debt's priority, the more likely it is to be repaid, at least in part.
