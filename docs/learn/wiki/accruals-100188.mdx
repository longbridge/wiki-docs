Accruals are revenues earned or expenses incurred that impact a company's net income on the income statement, although cash related to the transaction has not yet changed hands. Accruals also affect the balance sheet, as they involve non-cash assets and liabilities.For example, if a company has performed a service for a customer, but has not yet received payment, the revenue from that service would be recorded as an accrual in the company's financial statements. This ensures that the company's financial statements accurately reflect its true financial position, even if it has not yet received payment for all of the services it has provided.Accrual accounts include, among many others, accounts payable, accounts receivable, accrued tax liabilities, and accrued interest earned or payable.
