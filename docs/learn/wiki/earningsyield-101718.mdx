The earnings yield refers to the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period divided by the current market price per share. The earnings yield (the inverse of the P/E ratio) shows the percentage of a company's earnings per share. Earnings yield is used by many investment managers to determine optimal asset allocations and is used by investors to determine which assets seem underpriced or overpriced.
