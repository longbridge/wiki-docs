Euribor, or the Euro Interbank Offer Rate, is a reference rate that is constructed from the average interest rate at which eurozone banks offer unsecured short-term lending on the inter-bank market. The maturities on loans used to calculate Euribor often range from one week to one year.This is the benchmark rate with which banks lend or borrow excess reserves from one another over short periods of time, from one week to 12 months. These short-term loans are often structured as repurchase agreements (repos) and are intended to maintain bank liquidity and to make sure that excess cash is able to generate an interest return rather than sit idle.
