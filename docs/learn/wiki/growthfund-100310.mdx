A growth fund is a diversified portfolio of stocks that has capital appreciation as its primary goal, with little or no dividend payouts. The portfolio mainly consists of companies with above-average growth that reinvest their earnings into expansion, acquisitions, or research and developmentÂ (R&D). Most growth funds offer higher potential capital appreciation but usually at above-average risk.
