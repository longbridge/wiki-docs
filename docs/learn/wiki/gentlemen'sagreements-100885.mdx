A gentlemen's agreement is an informal, often unwritten agreement or transaction backed only by the integrity of the counterparty to actually abide by its terms. An agreement such as this is generally informal, made orally, and is not legally binding.Despite their more casual nature, a violation of a gentlemen's agreement could have a negative effect on business relationships if one party decides to renege on their promise. A gentlemen's agreement (also spelled "gentleman's agreement") may or may not be consummated by a handshake.
