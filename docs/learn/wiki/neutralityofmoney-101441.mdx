The neutrality of money, also called neutral money, is an economic theorystating that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables and not real variables. In other words, the amount of money printed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and central banks can impact prices and wages but not the output or structure of the economy.Modern versions of the theory accept that changes in the money supply might affect output or unemployment levels in the short run; however, many of todayâ€™s economists still believe that neutrality is assumed in the long run after money circulates throughout the economy.
