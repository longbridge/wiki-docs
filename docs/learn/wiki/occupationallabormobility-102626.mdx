Occupational labor mobility refers to the ability of workers to switch career fields in order to find gainful employment or meet the needs of industry. When conditions allow for high degrees of occupational labor mobility, it can help maintain strong employment and productivity levels. Governments may provide occupational retraining to help workers acquire the necessary skills and expedite this process.Geographical labor mobility, on the other hand, refers to the level of flexibility and freedom laborers have to physically move from one location to another in order to find gainful employment in their field.
