A stable value fund is a portfolio of bonds that are insured to protect the investor against a decline in yield or a loss of capital. The owner of a stable value fund will continue to receive the agreed-upon interest payments regardless of the state of the economy.Stable value funds are a common option in some retirement plans such as company 401(k) plans, especially aimed at those savers nearing retirement.
