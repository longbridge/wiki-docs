Merger arbitrage, often considered a hedge fund strategy, involves simultaneously purchasing and selling the respective stock of two merging companies to create "riskless" profits. Because there is the uncertainty of the deal being completed, the stock price of the target company typically sells at a price below the acquisition price.Â A merger arbitrageur will review the probability of a merger not closing on time or at all and will then purchase the stock before the acquisition, expecting to make a profit when the merger or acquisition completes.
