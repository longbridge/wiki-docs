The term maintenance expense refers to any cost incurred by an individual or business to keep their assets in good working condition. These costs may be spent for the general maintenance of items like running anti-virus software on computer systems or they may be used for repairs such as fixing a car or machinery. These expenses are in addition to the actual purchase price of an asset, so individuals and companies should be able and willing to foot the bill in order to keep their assets in running order.
