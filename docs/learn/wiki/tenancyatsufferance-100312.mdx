Tenancy at sufferance is created when a tenant has overstayed their lease term without a new agreement. In this case, the landlord can hold them to the terms of the old lease and collect rent payments for the time overstayed. This can continue until the landlord is able to obtain an eviction order, or decides to extend the lease.This can be contrasted with tenancy at will, where a tenant occupies the property with the consent of the owner but without necessarily a written contract or lease.
