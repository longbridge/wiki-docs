Growth investing is an investment style and strategy that is focused on increasing an investor's capital. Growth investors typically invest in growth stocksâ€”that is, young or small companies whose earnings are expected to increase at an above-average rate compared to their industry sector or the overall market.Growth investing is highly attractive to many investors because buying stock in emerging companies can provide impressive returns (as long as the companies are successful). However, such companies are untried, and thus often pose a fairly high risk.Growth investing may be contrasted with value investing. Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.
