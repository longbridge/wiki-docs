Debt auctions refer to the process in which the government or companies issue bonds to the public. During the bond issuance process, the government or companies will raise funds from the public through auctions or other means to raise funds or repay debts. Investors participating in bond auctions can bid based on their risk preferences and return requirements, and the bidder with the highest price will ultimately obtain the bonds.
