Option pricing theory estimates a value of an options contract by assigning a price, known as a premium, based on the calculated probability that the contract will finish in the money (ITM) at expiration. Essentially, option pricing theory provides an evaluation of an option's fair value, which traders incorporate into their strategies.Models used to price options account for variables such as current market price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, and time to expiration to theoretically value an option. Some commonly used models to value options are Black-Scholes, binomial option pricing, and Monte-Carlo simulation.
