Jointly and severally is a legal term that is used to describe a partnership or any other group of individuals in which each individual named shares responsibility equally.For example, if a judge rules that a number of people are jointly and severally liable for injuries suffered by a plaintiff, any one of those people may be pursued for payment of the full amount of the judgment.As the word severally implies, the phrasing of some contractual agreements may specify that some parties have proportional liability. For example, a partner with a 10% stake in a business may have a liability that is proportional to that 10% investment.Jointly and severally is sometimes referred to as joint and several liability.
