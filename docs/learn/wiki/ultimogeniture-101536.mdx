Ultimogeniture, also known as postremogeniture or junior right, is a system of inheritance whereby the youngest son gains possession of his deceased father's estate. Many rural areas of medieval England used this system, as well as parts of France. It often applied to farmland, but sometimes included other types of land in addition to personal property.This system is very rare today. On the contrary, primogeniture, which means inheritance by a firstborn son,Â is slightly more common today. Historically, primogeniture has been the most prevalent inheritance system.
