Absorption rate most commonly refers to a metric used in the real estate market to evaluate the rate at which available homes are sold in a specific market during a given time period. It is calculated by dividing the number of homes sold in the allotted time period by the total number of available homes. This equation can also be reversed to identify the amount of time it would take for the supply to be sold.Absorption rate is also a key part of the accounting industry. In this context, absorption rate refers to the way in which businesses calculate their overhead costs.
