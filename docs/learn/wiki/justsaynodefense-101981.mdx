A "just say no" defense is a strategy employed by boards of directors to discourage hostile takeovers by simply refusing to negotiate and rejecting outright whatever the prospective buyer might offer.The legality of a "just say no" defense may depend on whether the target company has a long-term strategy it is pursuing, which can include a merger with a firm other than the one making the takeover bid, or if the takeover bid undervalues the company.
