Absolute return is the return that an asset achieves over a specified period. This measure looks at the appreciation or depreciation, expressed as a percentage, that an asset, such as a stock or a mutual fund, achieves over a given period.Absolute return differs from relative return because it is concerned with the return of a particular asset and does not compare it to any other measure or benchmark.
