The Hindenburg Omen is a technical indicator that was designed to signal the increased probability of a stock market crash. It compares the percentage of new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows in stock prices to a predetermined reference percentage that is supposed to predict the increasing likelihood of a market crash.Named after Germany's Hindenburg airship that crashed on May 6, 1937, it was conceived and promoted byÂ James R. Miekka in 2010. It was reported that it had correctly predicted a significant stock market decline only 25% of the time.
