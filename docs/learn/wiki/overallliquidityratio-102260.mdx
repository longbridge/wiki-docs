The overall liquidity ratio is the measurement of a company's capacity to pay its outstanding liabilities with its assets on hand. The overall liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing total assets by the difference between its total liabilities and conditional reserves. This ratio is used in the insurance industry, as well as in the analysis of financial institutions.
