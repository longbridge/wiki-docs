The combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio is the ratio of all secured loans on a property to the value of a property.Â Lenders use the CLTV ratio to determine a prospective borrower's risk of default when more than one loan is used.The CLTV differs from the simple loan-to-value (LTV) ratio in that the LTV only includes the first or primary mortgage in its calculation.
