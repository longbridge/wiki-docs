An undivided account is an initial public offering (IPO) for which there are multiple underwriters, each taking responsibility for placing any shares that remain unsold. That is, each firm agrees to pick up the slack if other underwriters fail to sell the portion of the total number of shares that they have been allocated.This type of account is sometimes called an eastern account. Naturally, there is a variation called a western account.
