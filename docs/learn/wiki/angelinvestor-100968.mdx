An angel investor provides initial seed money for startup businesses, usually in exchange for ownership equity in the company.The angel investor may be involved in a series of projects on a purely professional basis or may be found among an entrepreneur's family and friends. The investor's involvement may be a one-time infusion of seed money or an ongoing injection of cash to get a product to market.Angel investors aren't usually in the loan business. They're putting money into an idea they like, with the expectation of a reward only if and when the business takes off.
