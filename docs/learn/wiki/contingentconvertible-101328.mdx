Contingent convertibles (CoCos) are debt instruments primarily issued by European financial institutions. These securities work in a fashion similar to traditional convertible bonds. They have a specific strike price that, once breached, allows the conversion of the bond into equity or stock.CoCos, also known as AT1 bonds, are high-yield, high-risk products. A CoCo is also referred to as an enhanced capital note (ECN). The importance of this hybrid debt security is that it carries specialized options that help the issuing financial institution absorb a capital loss.CoCos can help to shore up a bank’s balance sheets by allowing it to convert its debt to stock if specific, unfavorable capital conditions arise. They were created after the 2007–2008 global financial crisis to help undercapitalized banks and to reduce the potential for taxpayer-funded bailouts.
