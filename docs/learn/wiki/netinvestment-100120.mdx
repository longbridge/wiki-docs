Net investment is the total amount of money that a company spends on capital assets, minus the cost of the depreciation of those assets. This figure provides a sense of the real expenditure on durable goods such as plants, equipment, and software that are being used in the company's operations.Capital assets lose value over time due to wear and tear and obsolescence. Therefore, subtracting depreciation from gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) provides a more accurate picture of their actual value.Capital assets include all property and equipment that contribute to the productive capacity of the business. The total for capital assets also includes the costs of their upkeep, maintenance, repair, and installation.Net investment is a component of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP).In a nation's GDP, the figure indicates gross private domestic investment. It includes all expenditures by private companies and governments on real estate and inventories. Thus, it is a leading indicator of a nation's potential economic production capacity.
