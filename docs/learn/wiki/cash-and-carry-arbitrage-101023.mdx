Cash-and-carry-arbitrage is a market-neutral strategy combining the purchase of a long position in an asset such as a stock or commodity, and the sale (short) of a position in a futures contract on that same underlying asset. It seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies for the asset in the cash (or spot) market and futures market, in order to make riskless profits. The futures contract must be theoretically expensive relative to the underlying asset or the arbitrage will not be profitable.
