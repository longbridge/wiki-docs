A fiscal deficit is a shortfall in a government's income compared with its spending. A government that has a fiscal deficit is spending beyond its means.A fiscal deficit is calculated as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), or simply as total dollars spent in excess of income. In either case, the income figure includes only taxes and other revenues and excludes money borrowed to make up the shortfall.A fiscal deficit is different from fiscal debt. The latter is the total debt accumulated over years of deficit spending. It is also different from fiscal imbalance which is a measure of future difference between future debt obligations and revenue streams.
