Solvency is the ability of a company to meet its long-term debts and financial obligations. Solvency can be an important measure of financial health, since it's one way of demonstrating a company’s ability to manage its operations into the foreseeable future. The quickest way to assess a company’s solvency is by checking its shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet, which is the sum of a company’s assets minus liabilities.
