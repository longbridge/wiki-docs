The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is an important indicator for measuring manufacturing economic activity. It surveys purchasing activities, output, new orders, and employment of manufacturing companies to obtain an overall economic activity index. A PMI value greater than 50 indicates an expansionary state in the manufacturing economy, while a value less than 50 indicates a contractionary state. Manufacturing PMI is one of the important indicators that investors, analysts, and decision-makers pay attention to, as it can be used to assess the manufacturing economic condition of a country or region.
