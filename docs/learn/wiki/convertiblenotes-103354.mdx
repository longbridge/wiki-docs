Convertible notes are a type of hybrid financial instrument with characteristics of both bonds and stocks. Such notes can be converted into common stock under specific conditions. Note holders can choose to convert their notes into company stocks, thereby participating in the company's shareholder equity, or they can choose to maintain their note holding rights to receive the interest and principal return on the notes.
