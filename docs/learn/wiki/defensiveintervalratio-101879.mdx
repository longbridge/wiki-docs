The defensive interval ratio (DIR), also called the defensive interval period (DIP) or basic defense interval (BDI), is a financial metric that indicates the number of days that a company can operate without needing to access noncurrent assets, long-term assets whose full value cannot be obtained within the current accounting year, or additional outside financial resources.Alternatively, this can be viewed as how long a company can operate while relying only on liquid assets. The DIR is sometimes viewed as a financial efficiency ratio but is most commonly considered a liquidity ratio.
