Income inequality refers to how unevenly income is distributed throughout a population. The less equal the distribution, the greater the income inequality. Income inequality is often accompanied by wealth inequality, which is the uneven distribution of wealth.Populations can be divided up in different ways to show different levels and forms of income inequality, such as income inequality by gender or race. Different measures, such as the Gini Index, can be used to analyze the level of income inequality in a population.
