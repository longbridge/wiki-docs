Beta is a measure of market risk. Unlevered beta (or asset beta) measures the market risk of the company without the impact of debt.'Unlevering' a beta removes the financial effects of leverage thus isolating the risk due solely to company assets. In other words, how much did the company's equity contribute to its risk profile.
