Capacity utilization rate measures the percentage of an organization's potential output that is actually being realized. The capacity utilization rate of a company or a national economy may be measured in order to provide insight into how well it is reaching its potential.The formulaÂ for finding the rate is:(Actual Output / Potential Output ) x 100 = Capacity Utilization RateA number under 100% indicates that the organization is producing at less than its full potential.
