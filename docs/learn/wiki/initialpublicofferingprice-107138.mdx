The IPO price refers to the issuance price set by a company during its initial public offering. The IPO price is announced in the prospectus, and investors can decide whether to purchase the company's stocks based on the IPO price. The setting of the IPO price is usually determined jointly by the company and underwriters, taking into account factors such as market demand and company value.
