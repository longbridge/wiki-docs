The term "fiscal year-end" refers to the completion of any one-year or 12-month accounting period other than a typical calendar year. A fiscal year is often the period used for calculating annual financial statements. A company's fiscal year may differ from the calendar year, and may not close on December 31 due to the nature of a company's needs.Once companies choose its fiscal year-end—typically when they are first incorporating or forming their company—it is required to stick with it year to year. This allows accounting data to be consistent in terms of time frames.
