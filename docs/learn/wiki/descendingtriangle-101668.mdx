A descending triangle is a chart pattern used in technical analysis created by drawing one trend line connecting a series of lower highs and a second horizontalÂ trend line connecting a series of lows.A regular descending triangle pattern is commonly considered a bearish chart pattern or a continuation pattern with an established downtrend. However, a descending triangle pattern can also be bullish, with a breakout in the opposite direction, and is known as a reversal pattern.
