Non-sufficient funds (NSF), or insufficient funds, is the status of a checking account that does not have enough money to cover all transactions. NSF also describes the fee charged when a check is presented but cannot be covered by the balance in the account. Customers will see a “non-sufficient funds” or “insufficient funds” notice on a bank statement when attempting to withdraw more money than their account holds.When payment cannot be completed it is often considered as “bounced." If a bank receives a check written on an account with insufficient funds, the bank can refuse payment and charge the account holder an NSF fee. Additionally, a penalty or fee may be charged by the merchant for the returned check.
