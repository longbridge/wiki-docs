Earnings before interest after taxes (EBIAT) is one of a number of financial measures that are used to evaluate a company's operating performance for a quarter or a year.EBIAT measures a company's profitability without taking into account its capital structure, which is the combination of debt and stock issues that is reflected in debt to equity. EBIAT is a way to measure a company's ability to generate income from its operations for the period being examined while considering taxes.EBIAT is the same as after-tax EBIT.
