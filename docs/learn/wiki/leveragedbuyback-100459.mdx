A leveraged buyback is a corporate finance transaction that enables a company to repurchase some of its shares using debtâ€”reducing the number of shares outstanding increases the remaining owners' respective shares.Also known as a leveraged share repurchase, a leveraged buyback has similar impacts as leveraged recapitalizations and dividend recapitalizations, in which companies employ leverage to pay a one-time dividend. The difference is that dividend recapitalizations do not change the ownership structure.
