The Order Audit Trail System (OATS) is an automated computer system established by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). It is used to record information relating to orders, quotes, and other related trade data from all equities traded on the National Market System (NMS), including over-the-counter (OTC) stocks. This system simplifies an order's progression from the initial receipt of the order to its eventual execution or cancellation, for easy tracking or auditing purposes.
