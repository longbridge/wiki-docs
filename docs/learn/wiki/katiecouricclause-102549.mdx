The Katie Couric Clause was a slang term to refer to a controversial rule that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considered implementing in 2006, known formally as the Executive Compensation and Related Party Disclosure clause.The clause, which was ultimately not adopted, would have expanded on existing executive compensation rules, requiring companies to disclose the pay of up to three of the highest-paid non-executive employees at a company. The existing laws that the clause would have expanded upon require firms to report the salaries of CEOs, CFOs, and other high-ranking executive officers of public companies.The Katie Couric Clause was so-called because it would have likely forced CBS to disclose the pay of Katie Couric, who became CBS's highest-paid newscaster in April 2006, with a reported salary of US $15 million over five years. Her deal with CBS followed a 15-year tenure with NBC where she co-hosted "The Today Show."
