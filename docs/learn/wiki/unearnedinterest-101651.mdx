Unearned interest is interest that has been collected on a loan by a lending institution but has not yet been recognized as income (or earnings). Instead, it is initially recorded as a liability. If the loan is paid off early, the unearned interest portion must be returned to the borrower.Unearned interest is also called unearned discount.
