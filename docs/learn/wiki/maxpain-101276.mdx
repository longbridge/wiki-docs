Max pain, or the max pain price, is the strike price with the most open options contracts (i.e.,Â puts and calls), and it is the price at which the stock would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.The term max pain stems from the maximum pain theory, which states that most traders who buy and hold options contracts until expiration will lose money.
