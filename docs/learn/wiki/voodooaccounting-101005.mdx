The term voodoo accounting refers to a creative and unethical method of accounting that artificially inflates figures found on a company's financial statements. Voodoo accounting employs numerous accounting gimmicks to boost the bottom line by inflating revenue, concealing expenses, or both.The individual accounting maneuvers used in voodoo accounting may be minor, and one-time accounting gimmicks may be ignored by investors. However, repeat offenses often affect the companyâ€™s market value and reputation for the worse.
