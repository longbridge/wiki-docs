A drawing account is an accounting record maintained to track money and other assets withdrawn from a business by its owners. A drawing account is used primarily for businesses that are taxed as sole proprietorships or partnerships. Owner withdrawals from businesses that are taxed as separate entities must be accounted for generally as either compensation or dividends.
