The term nominal gross domestic product (GDP)  refers to the GDP evaluated at current market prices. Put simply, nominal GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a given time period less the value of those made during the production process. GDP is the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in a country. Nominal GDP is one way to measure how well the economy is doing. It differs from real GDP in that the first one doesn't include the changes in prices due to inflation.
