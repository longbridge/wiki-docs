The standard error (SE) of a statistic is the approximate standard deviation of a statistical sample population.The standard error is a statistical term that measures the accuracy with which a sample distribution represents a population by using standard deviation. In statistics, a sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error of the mean.
