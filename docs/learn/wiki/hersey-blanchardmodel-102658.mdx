The Hersey-Blanchard Model suggests no single leadership style is better than another. Instead of focusing on workplace factors, the model suggests that leaders should adjust their techniques to those they lead and their abilities.Under the model, successful leadership is both task-relevant and relationship-relevant. It is an adaptive, flexible style in which leaders are encouraged to consider their followers—individuals or a team—then consider the factors that impact the work environment before choosing how they will lead. This gives them a better chance of meeting their goals.The Hersey-Blanchard Model is also called the Situational Leadership Model or Theory.
