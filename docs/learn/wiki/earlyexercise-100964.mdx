Early exercise of an options contract is the process of buying or selling shares of stock under the terms of that option contract before its expiration date.Â For call options, the options holder can demand that the options seller sell shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. For put options it is the converse: the options holder may demand that the options seller buy shares of the underlying stock at the strike price.
