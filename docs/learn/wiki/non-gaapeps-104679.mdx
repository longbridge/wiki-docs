Non-GAAP EPS (Earnings Per Share) is a measure of a company's operating performance, which excludes the impact of certain non-recurring items on the company's profitability. Typically, non-GAAP EPS excludes special items, non-recurring gains or losses, and acquisition-related expenses, among others. This allows for a more accurate reflection of the company's core profitability.
