Rollover risk is a risk associated with the refinancing of debt. Rollover risk is commonly faced by countries and companies when a loan or other debt obligation (like a bond) is about to mature and needs to be converted, or rolled over, into new debt. If interest rates have risen in the meantime, they would have to refinance their debt at a higher rate and incur more interest charges in the futureâ€”or, in case of a bond issue, pay out more in interest. It is similar to reinvestment risk.Rollover risk may also refer to the risk of losing money when rolling derivatives positions.
