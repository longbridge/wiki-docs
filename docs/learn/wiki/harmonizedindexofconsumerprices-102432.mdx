The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is a measure of inflation in the European Union (EU). It reflects change over time in the prices paid by households for a representative basket of goods and services. The European Central Bank (ECB) uses the HICP for the Eurozone comprising the 19 EU states using the euro common currency to pursue its objective of price stability, defined as 2% annualized inflation over the medium term.
