Maturity mismatch is a term used to describe situations when there's a disconnect between a company's short-term assets and its short-term liabilitiesâ€”specifically more of the latter than the former. Maturity mismatches can also occur when a hedging instrument and the underlying asset's maturities are misaligned.A maturity mismatch may also be referred to as an asset-liability mismatch.
