Diluted common stock refers to the decrease in earnings per share of common stock after the issuance of new shares or convertible securities under specific circumstances. This is because the newly issued shares or convertible securities will increase the company's capital stock, thereby reducing earnings per share. Diluted common stock is a measure used to assess earnings per share.
