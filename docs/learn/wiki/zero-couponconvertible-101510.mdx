A zero-coupon convertible is a fixed income instrument that combines the features of a zero-coupon bond with that of a convertible bond.Due to the zero-coupon feature, the bond pays no interest and is therefore issued at a discount to par value, while the convertible feature means that bondholders have the option to convert bonds into common stock of the issuer at a certain conversion price.
