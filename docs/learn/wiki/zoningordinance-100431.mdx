A zoning ordinance is a rule that defines how property in specific geographic zones can be used. Zoning ordinances detail whether specific geographic zones are acceptable for residential or commercial purposes. Zoning ordinances may also regulate lot size, placement, density, architectural style, and the height of structures. Zoning ordinances also describe the procedures for how to handle any zoning rule infractions (including any penalties).
