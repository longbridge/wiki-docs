A cottage industry is a small manufacturing business that is owned and operated by an individual or a family, typically operating out of a home rather than a purpose-built facility.Cottage industries are defined by the small amount of investment that is required to start one. They often focus on producing labor-intensive goods but face a significant disadvantage when competing with factory-based manufacturers of mass-produced goods.
