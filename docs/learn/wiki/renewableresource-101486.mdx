A renewable resource is a resource that can be replenished naturally over time. As a result, it is sustainable despite its consumption by humankind.Renewable resources are considered especially important for their potential to replace non-renewable, or finite, resources in the production of energy. Additionally, renewable resources can offer cleaner energy solutions than those provided by non-renewable resources such as coal and fossil fuels.Examples of renewable resources include the sun, wind, water, the earth's heat (geothermal), and biomass.
