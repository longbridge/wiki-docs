Bond sell-off refers to the behavior of investors selling a large amount of bonds, leading to a drop in bond market prices. Bond sell-offs usually occur when concerns about the economic outlook or the credit quality of bond issuers increase, causing investors to sell bonds to hedge or seek higher returns. Bond sell-offs can lead to an increase in bond yields, causing losses to bond holders.
