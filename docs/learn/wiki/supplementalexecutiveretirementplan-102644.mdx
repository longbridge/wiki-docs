A supplemental executive retirement planÂ (SERP) is a set of benefits that may be made available to top-level employees in addition to those covered in the company's standard retirement savings plan.A SERP is a form of a deferred-compensation plan. It is not a qualified plan. That is, there is no special tax treatment for the company or the employee, such as is available through a 401(k) plan.
