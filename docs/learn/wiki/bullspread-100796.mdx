A bull spread is an optimistic options strategy designed to profit from a moderate rise in the price of a security or asset. A variety of vertical spread, a bull spread involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of either call options or put options with different strike prices but with the same underlying asset and expiration date. Whether a put or a call, the option with the lower strike price is bought and the one with the higher strike price is sold.A bull call spread is also called a debit call spread because the trade generates a net debt to the account when it is opened. The option purchased costs more than the option sold.
