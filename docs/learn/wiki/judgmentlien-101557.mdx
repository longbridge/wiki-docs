A judgment lien is a court ruling that gives a creditor the right to take possession of a debtor's property if the debtor fails to fulfill their contractual obligations. This lien may be made against an individual or business and allows the creditor to access assets such as the debtor's business, personal property, and real estate to satisfy the judgment.
