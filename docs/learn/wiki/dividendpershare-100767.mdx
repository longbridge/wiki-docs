Dividend per share (DPS) is the sum of declared dividends issued by a company for every ordinary share outstanding. The figure is calculated by dividing the total dividends paid out by a business, including interim dividends, over a period of time, usually a year,Â by the number of outstanding ordinary shares issued.A company's DPS is often derived using the dividend paid in the most recent quarter, which is also used to calculate the dividend yield.
