A currency exchange is a licensed business that allows customers toÂ exchange one currency for another. Currency exchange of physical money (coins and paper bills) is usually done over the counter at a teller station, which can be found in various places such as airports, banks, hotels, and resorts. Currency exchanges make money by charging a nominal fee and through the bid-ask spread in a currency.Also known as a "bureau de change" or "casa de cambio," a currency exchange should not be confused with the foreign exchange (forex) market where traders and financial institutions transact in currencies.
