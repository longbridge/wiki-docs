The bullish abandoned baby is a type of candlestick pattern that is used by traders to signal a reversal of a downtrend. It forms in a downtrend and is composed of three price bars. The first is a large down candle, followed by a doji candle that gaps below the first candle. The next candle opens higher than the doji and moves aggressively to the upside.The expectation is that the price will continue to move higher as the pattern shows that selling has been at least temporarily exhausted. The bullish abandoned baby can be contrasted with a bearish abandoned baby pattern, which marks the possible end of an uptrend.
