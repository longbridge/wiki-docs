Unsystematic risk is the risk that is unique to a specific company or industry. It's also known as nonsystematic risk, specific risk, diversifiable risk, or residual risk. In the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversificationâ€”while systematic risk is the risk that's inherent in the market.
