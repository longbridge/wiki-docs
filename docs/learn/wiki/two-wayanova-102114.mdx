ANOVA stands for analysis of variance and tests for differences in the effects of independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical test used to determine the effect of two nominal predictor variables on a continuous outcome variable.A two-way ANOVA tests the effect of two independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test analyzes the effect of the independent variables on the expected outcome along with their relationship to the outcome itself. Random factors would be considered to have no statistical influence on a data set, while systematic factors would be considered to have statistical significance.By using ANOVA, a researcher is able to determine whether the variability of the outcomes is due to chance or to the factors in the analysis. ANOVA has many applications in finance, economics, science, medicine, and social science.
