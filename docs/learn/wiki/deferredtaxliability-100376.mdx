A deferred tax liability is a listing on a company's balance sheet that records taxes that are owed but are not due to be paid until a future date.The liability is deferred due to a difference in timing between when the tax was accrued and when it is due to be paid.Â For example, it might reflect a taxable transaction such as an installment sale that took place one a certain date but the taxes will not be due until a later date.
