An isoquant curve is a concave-shaped line on a graph, used in the study of microeconomics, that charts all the factors, or inputs, that produce a specified level of output. This graph is used as a metric for the influence that the inputs—most commonly, capital and labor—have on the obtainable level of output or production.The isoquant curve assists companies and businesses in making adjustments to inputs to maximize production, and thus profits.
