A discount bond is a bond that is issued for less than its par—or face—value. Discount bonds may also be a bond currently trading for less than its face value in the secondary market. A bond is considered a deep-discount bond if it is sold at a significantly lower price than par value, usually at 20% or more.A discount bond may be contrasted with a bond sold at a premium.
