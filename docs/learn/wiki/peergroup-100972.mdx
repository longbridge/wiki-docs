The term peer group refers to a group of individuals or companies that share similar characteristics with one another. These characteristics may be age, education, ethnic background, size, industry, or sector. Peer groups are known for their influential nature as they are able to shape the decisions of members of the group. As such, peer groups often contain hierarchies, with clear leaders who sit at the top. Peer groups are often used in analysis in a number of academic and professional fields.
