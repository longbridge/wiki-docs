Debt repayment ability refers to the ability of a company or individual to repay debts on time when they are due. Debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio and other indicators are usually used to measure the debt repayment ability of a company. The stronger the debt repayment ability, the stronger the company's ability to face risks.
