End-to-end describes a process that takes a system or service from beginning to end and delivers a complete functional solution, usually without needing to obtain anything from a third party. It often refers to vendors that can see a project through from beginning to end, and supply everything needed to create a workable solutionâ€”be it hardware, software, labor, written materials, and procedures.End-to-end solutions also adhere to a philosophy that eliminates middle layers or steps, which helps to optimize the performance and efficiency of a business. This includes pulling in minimal parties along the full project life cycle to ensure minimal disruptions are incurred from start to finish. It is most commonly used in the information technology (IT) sector.
