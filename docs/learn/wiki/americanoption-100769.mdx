An American option, aka an American-style option, is a version of an options contract that allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. It contrasts with another type of option, called the European option, that only allows execution on the day of expiration.An American-style option allows investors to capture profit as soon as the stock price moves favorably, and to take advantage of dividend announcements as well.
