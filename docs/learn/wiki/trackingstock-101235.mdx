A tracking stock is a special equity offering issued by a parent company that tracks the financial performance of a particular segment or division. Tracking stocks will trade in the open market separately from the parent company's stock.Tracking stocks allow larger companies to isolate the financial performance of a higher growth segment. In turn, tracking stocks give investors the ability to gain exposure to a specific aspect of a larger company's business (e.g., the mobile division within a large telecom provider).
