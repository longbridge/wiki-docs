Anti-competitive behavior refers to the actions taken by companies to restrict competition and harm other companies or markets. These actions may include monopolies, monopolistic pricing, market segmentation, and excluding competitors. Anti-competitive behavior is generally considered to be a violation of anti-trust laws and can lead to market distortion and unfair competition.
