Cash flow is the net cash and cash equivalents transferred in and out of a company. Cash received represents inflows, while money spent represents outflows. A company creates value for shareholders through its ability to generate positive cash flows and maximize long-term free cash flow (FCF). FCFÂ is the cash from normal business operations after subtracting any money spent on capital expenditures (CapEx).
