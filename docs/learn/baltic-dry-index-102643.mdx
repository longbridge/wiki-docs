<p>The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London-based Baltic Exchange. It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials, such as coal and steel.</p><p>Members of the exchange directly contact shipping brokers to assess price levels for given shipping paths, a product to transport, and time to delivery or speed. The Baltic Dry Index is a composite of four sub-indices that measure different sizes of dry bulk carriers&nbsp;or merchant ships: Capesize, Panamax, Supramax, and Handysize.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a shipping and trade index created by the London Baltic Exchange. It measures changes in the cost of transporting various raw materials such as coal and steel. BDI is a crucial indicator of the global shipping market, reflecting the supply and demand conditions in the dry bulk shipping market.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Baltic Dry Index was first introduced in 1985 to provide a transparent and reliable price reference for the shipping market. With the development of global trade, BDI has gradually become an important indicator of the health of the global economy.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> BDI is composed of four sub-indices, each measuring different sizes of dry bulk carriers or merchant ships:<ul><li><strong>Capesize:</strong> These vessels are typically used to transport iron ore and coal, navigating between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</li><li><strong>Panamax:</strong> These vessels are sized to pass through the Panama Canal and are mainly used to transport grain and coal.</li><li><strong>Supramax:</strong> Slightly smaller than Panamax vessels, these are used for shorter distance transport, typically carrying grain, coal, and ore.</li><li><strong>Handysize:</strong> The smallest of the vessels, suitable for coastal and inland transport, mainly carrying grain, fertilizers, and steel products.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> During the 2008 global financial crisis, BDI plummeted from 11,793 points to 663 points, reflecting a sharp decline in global trade activities. This change helped investors and policymakers understand the health of the global economy in a timely manner.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, BDI dropped significantly, but as the global economy gradually recovered, BDI rebounded sharply in 2021, reaching multi-year highs. This fluctuation reflected the recovery of global supply chains and increased demand.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Can BDI accurately predict economic trends?</strong> While BDI is an important economic indicator, it cannot predict economic trends on its own. Investors should analyze it in conjunction with other economic data.</li><li><strong>Why is BDI so volatile?</strong> The volatility of BDI is mainly influenced by global trade activities, changes in the supply and demand of the shipping market, and geopolitical factors.</li></ul></p>`} id={102643} />
