<p>Participatory Note (P-Note) is a financial instrument typically issued by registered Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in India, allowing unregistered foreign investors to indirectly invest in Indian securities markets. Through P-Notes, foreign investors can gain exposure to the returns and risks of Indian securities without directly trading on the Indian markets. This instrument is often used to bypass India's regulatory and tax requirements, providing a more straightforward investment route. However, due to its anonymity and potential for misuse, P-Notes have also attracted scrutiny from regulatory bodies.</p>
