Participatory notes also referred to as P-notes, or PNs, are financial instruments required by investors or hedge funds to invest in Indian securities without having to register with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). P-notes are among the group of investments considered to be Offshore Derivative Investments (ODIs).Any dividends or capital gains collected from the securities go back to the investors. Indian regulators are generally not in support of participatory notes because they fear that hedge funds acting through participatory notes will cause economic volatility in India's exchanges.
