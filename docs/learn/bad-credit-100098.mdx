Bad credit refers to a person's history of not paying bills on time and the likelihood that they will fail to make timely payments in the future. For individuals it is often reflected in a low credit score. Having bad credit makes it difficult to borrow money, especially at competitive interest rates. Businesses can also have bad credit.
