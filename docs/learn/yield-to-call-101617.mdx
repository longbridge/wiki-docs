Yield to call (YTC) is a financial term that refers to the return a bondholder receives if the bond is held until the call date, which occurs sometime before it reaches maturity. This number can be mathematically calculated as the compound interest rate at which the present value of a bond's future coupon payments and call price is equal to the current market price of the bond.Yield to call applies to callable bonds, which are debt instruments that let bond investors redeem the bonds—or the bond issuer to repurchase them—on what is known as the call date, at a price known as the call price. By definition, the call date of a bond chronologically occurs before the maturity date.Generally speaking, bonds are callable over several years. They are normally called at a slight premium above their face value, though the exact call price is based on prevailing market rates.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Yield to Call (YTC)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Yield to Call (YTC) refers to the return a bondholder receives if the bond is held until the call date, which is before the bond's maturity date. This figure is calculated by making the present value of the bond's future coupon payments and call price equal to the bond's current market price. YTC applies to callable bonds, which are debt instruments that allow bond investors to redeem the bond at a known call price on a specified call date, or for the issuer to repurchase the bond.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of YTC originated with the development of the bond market, particularly in the early 20th century when corporations and governments began issuing callable bonds to attract investors. As financial markets became more complex, investors needed a method to evaluate the potential returns of these bonds, leading to the development of YTC calculation methods.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>YTC mainly applies to the following two types of bonds:</p><ul><li><strong>Callable Bonds:</strong> These bonds allow the issuer to redeem the bond at a predetermined price before a specified date. Typically, these bonds can be called within a few years, and the call price is usually slightly above the face value.</li><li><strong>Non-Callable Bonds:</strong> These bonds do not have an early redemption option, and investors can only receive the principal and interest at maturity.</li></ul><p>Characteristics of YTC include:</p><ul><li>Complex Calculation: It requires discounting future coupon payments and the call price to the current market price.</li><li>Market Sensitivity: YTC is affected by changes in market interest rates.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose an investor purchases a callable bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, annual interest payments, a market price of $950, a call price of $1,050, and a call period of 5 years. By calculation, the investor can determine the YTC to be 6.2%.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company issues a batch of callable bonds with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 4%, a market price of $980, a call price of $1,020, and a call period of 3 years. Investors calculate the YTC to be 4.5%.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: What is the difference between YTC and Yield to Maturity (YTM)?</strong><br/>A1: YTC considers the possibility of the bond being called before maturity, while YTM assumes the bond is held until maturity.</p><p><strong>Q2: Why does YTC change?</strong><br/>A2: YTC changes with market interest rates because these rates affect the bond's market price and the present value of future cash flows.</p>`} id={101617} />
