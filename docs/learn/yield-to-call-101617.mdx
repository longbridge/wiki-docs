Yield to call (YTC) is a financial term that refers to the return a bondholder receives if the bond is held until the call date, which occurs sometime before it reaches maturity. This number can be mathematically calculated as the compound interest rate at which the present value of a bond's future coupon payments and call price is equal to the current market price of the bond.Yield to call applies to callable bonds, which are debt instruments that let bond investors redeem the bonds—or the bond issuer to repurchase them—on what is known as the call date, at a price known as the call price. By definition, the call date of a bond chronologically occurs before the maturity date.Generally speaking, bonds are callable over several years. They are normally called at a slight premium above their face value, though the exact call price is based on prevailing market rates.
