A build-operate-transfer (BOT)Â contract is a model used to finance large projects, typically infrastructure projects developed through public-private partnerships.The BOT scheme refers to the initial concession by a public entity such as a local government to a private firm to both build and operate the project in question. After a set time frame, typically two or three decades, control of the project is returned to the public entity.
