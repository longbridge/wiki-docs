<p>An Inventory Write-Off is the process by which a company removes the recorded value of inventory from its financial statements when the inventory is deemed unsellable or unusable. This situation typically arises due to factors such as damage, obsolescence, theft, or changes in market demand, which cause the inventory's actual value to be significantly lower than its book value, or even worthless. An inventory write-off directly impacts a company's profits, as the write-off amount is recorded as an expense on the income statement, thereby reducing the company's net income. The handling of inventory write-offs must comply with relevant accounting standards and policies to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the financial statements.</p>
