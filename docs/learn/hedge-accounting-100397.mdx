Hedge accounting is a method of accounting in which entries to adjust the fair value of a security and its opposing hedge are treated as one. Hedge accounting attempts to reduce the volatility created by the repeated adjustment to a financial instrument's value, known as fair value accounting or mark to market. This volatility is reduced by combining the instrument and the hedge as one entry, which offsets the opposing's movements.
