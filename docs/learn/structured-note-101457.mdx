<p>A structured note is a debt obligation that also contains an embedded derivative component that adjusts the security's risk-return profile. The return performance of a structured note will track both the underlying debt obligation and the derivative embedded within it. This type of note is a hybrid security that attempts to change its profile by including additional modifying structures, thus increasing the bond's potential return.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A structured note is a debt obligation that includes an embedded derivative component, which can adjust the risk-return profile of the security. The performance of a structured note tracks the underlying debt obligation and the embedded derivative. This type of note is a hybrid security that attempts to enhance potential returns by including additional structural modifications.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Structured notes originated in the 1980s when advancements in financial engineering allowed financial institutions to design more complex financial products.
