The term budget surplus refers to a situation that occurs when income exceeds expenditures. The term is often used to describe a corporation or government's financial state, unlike individuals who have savings instead of budget surpluses. A surplus indicates that a government's finances are being effectively managed. The opposite of a budget surplus is a budget deficit, which commonly occurs when spending exceeds income.
