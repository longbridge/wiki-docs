The Loan Credit Default Swap Index (Markit LCDX) is a specialized index of loan-only credit default swaps (CDS) covering 100 North American companies with unsecured debt trading in broad secondary markets. The LCDX is traded over-the-counter, and several large investment banks manage it, provide liquidity, and assist in pricing individual credit default swaps. IHS Markit Ltd, headquartered in London, is the index provider.
