Impaired credit typically refers to a deterioration in the perceived creditworthiness of an individual, a business, or other entity. Impaired credit is usually reflected for individuals in a lower credit score and for businesses and other entities as a lower credit rating. Would-be borrowers with impaired credit will find it harder to obtain loans and generally have to pay higher interest rates if they do. Impaired credit can be either a temporary and fixable condition or a warning sign that even greater financial distress may lie ahead.
