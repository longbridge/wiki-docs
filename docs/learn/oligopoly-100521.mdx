An oligopoly is a type of market structure that exists within an economy. In an oligopoly, there is a small number of firms that control the market. A key characteristic of an oligopoly is that none of these firms can keep the other(s) from having significant influence over the market. The concentration ratio measures the market share of the largest firms. There is no precise upper limit to the number of firms in an oligopoly, but the number must be low enough that the actions of one firm significantly influence the others. An oligopoly is different from a monopoly, which is a market with only one producer.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Oligopoly</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>An oligopoly is a market structure in which a small number of firms control the market. A key characteristic of an oligopoly is that these firms cannot prevent other companies from having a significant impact on the market. The concentration ratio measures the market share of the largest firms. There is no clear upper limit on the number of firms in an oligopoly, but the number must be low enough that the actions of one firm significantly affect the others. Oligopoly is different from monopoly, where there is only one producer in the market.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of oligopoly originated in early 20th-century economic research. With the development of industrialization, many industries began to be dominated by a few firms, attracting the attention of economists. In the 1920s, American economists Edward Chamberlin and Joan Robinson respectively proposed theories of monopolistic competition and imperfect competition, laying the foundation for the study of oligopoly.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Oligopolies can be divided into two categories: homogeneous oligopoly and heterogeneous oligopoly. Homogeneous oligopoly refers to markets where products are essentially the same, such as the steel industry; heterogeneous oligopoly refers to markets where products differ, such as the automobile industry. Characteristics of oligopolies include high market concentration, interdependence among firms, and high entry barriers.</p><h3>Comparison with Similar Concepts</h3><p>Oligopoly is distinct from monopoly and perfect competition. A monopoly is a market with only one producer, while a perfectly competitive market has many producers, and no single firm can influence the market price.</p><h3>Case Studies</h3><p>1. <strong>Airline Industry:</strong> In many countries, the airline industry is a typical oligopoly. A few large airlines control most of the market share, and their pricing and service strategies affect each other. For example, the four major airlines in the United States (American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines) dominate the market.</p><p>2. <strong>Telecommunications Industry:</strong> The telecommunications industry is another example of an oligopoly. A few large telecom companies control the market, such as China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom in China. The competitive and cooperative relationships among these companies influence market pricing and service quality.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. <strong>Is an oligopoly market beneficial to consumers?</strong> An oligopoly market may lead to higher prices and fewer choices, but it can also bring innovation and high-quality services.</p><p>2. <strong>How to identify if a market is an oligopoly?</strong> Market concentration indicators, such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, can be used to measure the degree of market concentration.</p>`} id={100521} />
