An oligopoly is a type of market structure that exists within an economy. In an oligopoly, there is a small number of firms that control the market. A key characteristic of an oligopoly is that none of these firms can keep the other(s) from having significant influence over the market. The concentration ratio measures the market share of the largest firms. There is no precise upper limit to the number of firms in an oligopoly, but the number must be low enough that the actions of one firm significantly influence the others. An oligopoly is different from a monopoly, which is a market with only one producer.
