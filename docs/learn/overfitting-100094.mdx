Overfitting is a modeling error in statistics that occurs when a function is too closely aligned to a limited set of data points. As a result, the model is useful in reference only to its initial data set, and not to any other data sets.Overfitting the model generally takes the form of making an overly complex model to explain idiosyncrasies in the data under study. In reality, the data often studied has some degree of error or random noise within it. Thus, attempting to make the model conform too closely to slightly inaccurate data can infect the model with substantial errors and reduce its predictive power.
