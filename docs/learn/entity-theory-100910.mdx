The entity theory is a legal theory and accounting concept that all of the business activity conducted by any corporation or limited liability business is separate from that of its owners. The entity theory has two aspects. In accounting, it means that business and personal accounts, transactions, assets, and liabilities should be accounted for under separate and district entities independently of the owners' personal finances. In business law, it means that, under the premise of limited liability, the owners of a business that is structured as a separate entity should not be held personally liable for the liabilities incurred by the business.Despite some criticisms, due in large part to its fictitious nature and the agency problems it creates in practice, the entity theory has been invaluable to limited liability company (LLC) accounting practices and the status of corporations today as juridical persons.
