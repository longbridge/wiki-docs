<p>Incidental Liability, also known as ancillary liability or collateral liability, refers to secondary or supplementary liability that arises in addition to the primary liability due to certain specific actions or circumstances. This type of liability typically occurs as a result of incidental or unintended actions during the performance of primary obligations, leading to losses or damages. For example, during the execution of a contract, if one party negligently causes property damage to the other party, they may incur incidental liability in addition to their primary contractual obligations. The specific scope and conditions of incidental liability are usually defined in laws, contracts, or agreements.</p>
