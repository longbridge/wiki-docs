A non-sampling error is a statistical term that refers to an error that results during data collection, causing the data to differ from the true values. A non-sampling error differs from a sampling error. A sampling error is limited to any differences between sample values and universe values that arise because the sample size was limited. (The entire universe cannot be sampled in a survey or a census.)A sampling error can result even when no mistakes of any kind are made. The "errors" result from the mere fact that data in a sample is unlikely to perfectly match data in the universe from which the sample is taken. This "error" can be minimized by increasing the sample size.Non-sampling errors cover all other discrepancies, including those that arise from a poor sampling technique.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Non-Sampling Error</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Non-sampling error refers to errors that occur during the data collection process, leading to discrepancies between the collected data and the true values. Unlike sampling error, non-sampling error is not due to the limited sample size but arises from various other factors.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of non-sampling error originated in the fields of statistics and survey research. As data collection methods became more diverse and complex, researchers realized that many factors other than sampling error could lead to data bias. These factors include human errors during data collection, questionnaire design flaws, data processing errors, and more.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Non-sampling errors can be categorized as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Measurement Error:</strong> Biases due to inaccurate measurement tools or methods. For example, poorly designed questionnaires or respondent misunderstandings.</li><li><strong>Processing Error:</strong> Errors occurring during data entry, coding, or analysis. For example, data entry mistakes or improper use of statistical software.</li><li><strong>Response Error:</strong> Errors due to respondents providing inaccurate or incomplete information. For example, respondents intentionally hiding information or memory errors.</li><li><strong>Coverage Error:</strong> Biases due to the survey not fully covering the target population. For example, certain groups being excluded from the survey.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> In a national health survey, due to poorly designed questionnaires, many respondents misunderstood certain questions, leading to data results that did not reflect the actual situation. This is an example of measurement error.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> In a market survey, due to the negligence of data entry personnel, some data were incorrectly entered into the database, resulting in biased final analysis results. This is an example of processing error.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> How can non-sampling error be reduced?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Non-sampling error can be reduced by improving questionnaire design, enhancing data processing training, using more accurate measurement tools, and other methods.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can non-sampling error be completely eliminated?<br/><strong>A:</strong> It is challenging to completely eliminate non-sampling error, but its impact can be minimized through various methods.</p>`} id={101367} />
