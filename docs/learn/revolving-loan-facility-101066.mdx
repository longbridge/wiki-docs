A revolving loan facility is a form of credit issued by a financial institution that provides the borrower with the ability to draw down or withdraw, repay, and withdraw again. A revolving loan is considered a flexible financing tool due to its repayment and re-borrowing accommodations. It is not considered a term loan because, during an allotted period of time, the facility allows the borrower to repay the loan or take it out again. In contrast, a term loan provides a borrower with funds followed by a fixed payment schedule.
