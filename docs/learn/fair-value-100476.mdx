Fair value is the estimated price at which an asset is bought or sold when both the buyer and seller freely agree on a price.To determine the fair value of a product or financial investment, an individual or business may look at actual market transactions for similar assets, estimate the expected earnings of the asset, and determine the cost to replace the asset.
