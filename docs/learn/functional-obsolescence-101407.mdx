Functional obsolescence is the reduction of an object's usefulness or desirability because of an outdated design feature that cannot be easily changed or updated.The application of the term varies based on industry. For example, in real estate, it refers to the loss of property value due to an obsolete feature, such as an old house with one bathroom in a neighborhood filled with new homes that have at least three bathrooms. It may also refer to outdated technologies, such as an older version of a mobile phone or computer processor.Obsolescence risk is the risk that a process, product, or technology used or produced by a company for profit will become functionally obsolete, and thus no longer competitive in the marketplace.
