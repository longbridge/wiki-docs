The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistic developed and compiled by the United Nations since 1990 to measure various countriesâ€™ levels of social and economic development. It is composed of four principal areas of interest: mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, life expectancy at birth, and gross national income (GNI) per capita.This index is a tool used to follow changes in development levels over time and compare the development levels of different countries.
