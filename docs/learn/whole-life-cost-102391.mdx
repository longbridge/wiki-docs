Whole-life cost is the total expense of owning an asset over its entire life, from purchase to disposal, as determined by financial analysis. It is also known as the life-cycle cost, the lifetime cost, "cradle to grave," or "womb to tomb." Whole-life cost includes purchase and installation, design and building costs, operating costs, maintenance, associated financing costs, depreciation, and disposal costs.Whole-life cost also takes into account certain costs that are usually overlooked, such as those related to environmental and social impact factors. In the example of constructing a nuclear power station, it is possible to calculate the environmental impact of making the concrete containment and the water required for copper refinement, in addition to other components.Whereas a number of options may be portrayed as "good" for the environment, a whole-life cost analysis allows a determination of whether or not one solution carries a lower or higher environmental cost than another.
