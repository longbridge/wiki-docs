An earnings call is a conference call between the management of a public company, analysts, investors, and the media to discuss the companyâ€™s financial results during a given reporting period, such as a quarter or a fiscal year. An earnings call is usually preceded by an earnings report, which contains summary information on financial performance for the period.
