<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Debt service refers to the process by which a borrower repays the principal and interest of a debt according to the agreed schedule and amount. Debt service includes regular interest payments and principal repayment at maturity. For both businesses and individuals, debt service capacity is an important indicator of financial health. Failure to meet debt service obligations can lead to default, credit rating downgrades, and even bankruptcy.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of debt service dates back to ancient times when lending and borrowing activities already existed. With the development of financial markets, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries, the forms and structures of debt service have become more complex and diversified. In the modern financial system, debt service has become an essential part of financial management for both businesses and individuals.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Debt service can be divided into fixed-rate debt service and floating-rate debt service. Fixed-rate debt service is characterized by a constant interest rate throughout the loan period, allowing the borrower to predict each payment amount, making it suitable for risk-averse borrowers. Floating-rate debt service has an interest rate that adjusts according to market rate changes, which may lead to payment uncertainty but allows borrowers to benefit from lower interest costs when rates decline.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p>Case 1: A company borrows 1 million yuan from a bank for a term of 5 years at an annual interest rate of 5%. The company needs to pay 50,000 yuan in interest each year and repay the principal of 1 million yuan at maturity. This is a typical example of fixed-rate debt service.</p><p>Case 2: An individual uses a credit card for consumption, and the credit card has a floating interest rate that adjusts with market rate changes. The monthly interest and principal payments vary, which is an example of floating-rate debt service.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p>1. How is debt service capacity calculated?<br/>Debt service capacity is usually measured by the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), which is calculated as: DSCR = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service. A DSCR greater than 1 indicates that the borrower has sufficient income to cover debt service.</p><p>2. What are the consequences of debt service default?<br/>Debt service default can lead to credit rating downgrades, increased borrowing costs, and may even result in legal actions and bankruptcy.</p>`} id={101169} />
