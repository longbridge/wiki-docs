The interbank market is a global network utilized by financial institutions to trade currencies and other currency derivatives directly between themselves.Â While some interbank trading is done by banks on behalf of large customers, most interbank trading is proprietary, meaning that it takes place on behalf of the banks' own accounts. Banks use the interbank market to manage their own exchange rate and interest rate risk as well as to take speculative positions based on research.The interbank market is a subset of the interdealer market, which is an over-the-counter (OTC) venue where financial institutions can trade a variety of asset classes among one another and on behalf of their clients, often facilitated by interdealer brokers (IDBs).
