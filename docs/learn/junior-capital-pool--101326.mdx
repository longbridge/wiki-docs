A junior capital pool (JCP) is a corporate capital structure that allows early-stage startups to sell shares in the company before actually establishing a line of business. This form of company financing is a Canadian invention and is permitted only in Canada.The JCP may also be known as a capital pool company (CPC).The JPC is, essentially, a shell corporation with no assets other than cash, which has not yet begun business operations. Their issues might be described as stock options rather than stock shares, since their value remains to be determined at a future date.
