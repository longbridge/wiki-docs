The Dow Theory is a financial theory that says the market is in an upward trend if one of its averages (e.g., industrials or transportation) advances above a previous important high and is accompanied or followed by a similar advance in another average. For example, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbs to an intermediate high, an investor might watch the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) climb to confirm an upward trend.
