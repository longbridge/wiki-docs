A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit a financial institution extends to a client on a credit card or a line of credit. Lenders usually set credit limits based on specific information about the credit-seeking applicant, including their income and employment status. Credit limits are an important factor that can affect consumers' credit scores and their ability to obtain credit in the future.
