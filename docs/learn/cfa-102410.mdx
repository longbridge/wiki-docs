A chartered financial analyst (CFA) is a globally-recognized professional designation given by the CFA Institute, (formerly the AIMR (Association for Investment Management and Research)), that measures and certifies the competence and integrity of financial analysts. Candidates are required to pass three levels of exams covering areas, such as accounting, economics, ethics, money management, and security analysis.From 1963 to the first half of 2022, more than two million candidates have sat for the Level I exam, with 291,500 candidates ultimately going on to pass the Level III exam, representing a weighted average completion rate of around 11%. In the last 10 years, the completion rate was slightly lower at 9.6%.
