<p>Net Profit After Deducting Non-Recurring Gains and Losses refers to the profit of a company after excluding non-recurring gains and losses (such as asset disposal gains, government grants, fines, etc.). This metric provides a more accurate reflection of a company's operating performance and sustainable profitability, as it excludes items that are not regular or recurring.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Net profit after deducting non-recurring gains and losses refers to the net profit obtained after excluding the impact of non-recurring gains and losses when calculating a company's profitability. Non-recurring gains and losses are one-time incomes and expenses that are not directly related to the company's normal business activities, occur infrequently, and are not directly related to operating income and costs. This measure can more accurately reflect the company's profitability and operational capability.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of net profit after deducting non-recurring gains and losses originated from the need for financial analysis to provide a more realistic and stable profitability indicator. As business environments become more complex, relying solely on net profit is insufficient to fully reflect a company's operational status, necessitating the exclusion of sporadic and non-sustainable incomes and expenses.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-recurring gains and losses mainly include but are not limited to the following categories:<ul><li>Asset disposal gains or losses: Such as gains or losses from selling fixed assets or investment properties.</li><li>Government subsidies: Grants received by the company due to policy reasons.</li><li>Losses due to natural disasters or unexpected events: Such as losses from fires, earthquakes, etc.</li></ul>The characteristics of these non-recurring gains and losses are unpredictability, non-sustainability, and irrelevance to the company's daily operations.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>A company sold an idle piece of land in 2023, earning a one-time gain of 5 million yuan. This gain is a non-recurring gain and should be excluded from net profit to calculate the net profit after deducting non-recurring gains and losses.</li><li>Another company incurred a one-time loss of 3 million yuan in 2024 due to an earthquake that destroyed its factory. This loss is also a non-recurring loss and should be excluded from net profit.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why deduct non-recurring gains and losses?</strong> Because non-recurring gains and losses are sporadic and cannot reflect the company's sustainable profitability.</li><li><strong>How to identify non-recurring gains and losses?</strong> It usually requires a combination of the company's financial statement notes and management explanations to determine.</li></ul></p>`} id={140} />
