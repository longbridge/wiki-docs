The upside/downside ratio is a market breadth indicator that shows the relationship between the volumes of advancing and declining issues on an exchange. Investors typically use this indicator to determine the momentum of the market at any given time.The upside/downside ratio is a variation on the advance-decline ratio (ADR),  which compares the number, and not the trading volume, of stocks that closed higher against the number of stocks that closed lower than their previous day's closing prices.
