The expiration time of an options contract or other derivative is the exact date and time when it is rendered null and void. Derivatives contracts that finish out of the money (OTM) at the time of expiration will become worthless, while in-the-money (ITM) contracts will be evaluated based on the settlement price upon expiry.The expiration time is more specific than the expiration date and should not be confused with the last time to trade that option.
