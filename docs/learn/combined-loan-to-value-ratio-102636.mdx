<p>The combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio is the ratio of all secured loans on a property to the value of a property.&nbsp;Lenders use the CLTV ratio to determine a prospective borrower's risk of default when more than one loan is used.</p><p>The CLTV differs from the simple loan-to-value (LTV) ratio in that the LTV only includes the first or primary mortgage in its calculation.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV) ratio is the ratio of all secured loan balances on a property to the property's value. When multiple loans are used, lenders use the CLTV ratio to assess the risk of potential borrower default. CLTV differs from the simple Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which only includes the first or primary mortgage in its calculation.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the CLTV ratio originated from the need for financial institutions to manage loan risk. As the real estate market developed, more borrowers began using multiple loans for financing, making the single LTV ratio insufficient for comprehensive risk assessment. Thus, the CLTV ratio emerged to more fully reflect a borrower's debt situation.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The CLTV ratio is mainly divided into two categories:<ul><li>High CLTV ratio: Typically above 80%, indicating higher borrower debt and greater default risk.</li><li>Low CLTV ratio: Typically below 80%, indicating lower borrower debt and lesser default risk.</li></ul>Characteristics of the CLTV ratio include:<ul><li>Comprehensiveness: Considers all secured loans, not just the primary mortgage.</li><li>Risk Assessment: Helps lenders more accurately assess the risk of borrower default.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: Suppose a borrower owns a property worth $1,000,000, with a first mortgage balance of $500,000 and a second mortgage balance of $200,000. The CLTV ratio would be (50+20)/100=70%.</li><li>Case 2: Another borrower owns a property worth $2,000,000, with a first mortgage balance of $1,000,000, a second mortgage balance of $600,000, and a third mortgage balance of $200,000. The CLTV ratio would be (100+60+20)/200=90%.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Q: How does the CLTV ratio differ from the LTV ratio?<br/>A: The CLTV ratio includes all secured loans, whereas the LTV ratio only includes the first or primary mortgage.</li><li>Q: Does a high CLTV ratio mean a loan application will be rejected?<br/>A: Not necessarily, but a high CLTV ratio typically indicates higher default risk, and lenders may require higher interest rates or additional collateral.</li></ul></p>`} id={102636} />
