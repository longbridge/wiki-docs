<p>An Unofficial Strike, also known as a Wildcat Strike, refers to a work stoppage that is not officially sanctioned or organized by a labor union or relevant authority. Participants typically engage in such strikes spontaneously due to dissatisfaction with working conditions, wages, or other employment terms. Because these strikes lack formal union backing, they are often considered illegal and may result in disciplinary actions or legal consequences for the participants. Unofficial strikes usually occur suddenly and without prior notice or negotiation procedures.</p>
