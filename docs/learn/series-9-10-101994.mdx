Series 9/10 refers to a two-part securities exam and license entitling the holder to supervise sales activities at a general securities-oriented branch office. Before taking the Series 9/10 Exams, also known as the General Securities Sales Supervisor Qualification Exams, a candidate must have a Series 7 license.The Series 9/10 covers topics such as the supervision of options and general securities sales and trading practices in primary and secondary markets. The Series 9/10 exams are administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and were formerly known as the Series 8 Exam. As the name would suggest, the exam is broken into two parts; the Series 9 is the shorter and covers options sales and trading, as well as regulation and administration. Series 10 represents a deeper dive into a similar but broader range of topics and requirements.
