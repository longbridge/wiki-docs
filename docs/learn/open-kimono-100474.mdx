<p>A public audit, also known as an external audit or independent audit, is an audit conducted by a third-party auditing firm that is independent of the entity being audited. The purpose of a public audit is to provide an independent and objective examination and evaluation of an organization's financial statements and related information to ensure their accuracy, fairness, and compliance with applicable standards and regulations. Public audits help enhance the transparency and credibility of an organization and prevent financial fraud and errors.</p>
