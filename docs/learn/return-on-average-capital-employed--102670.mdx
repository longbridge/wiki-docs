The return on average capital employed (ROACE) is a financial ratio that shows profitability versus the investments a company has made in itself. This metric differs from the related return on capital employed (ROCE) calculation, in that it takes the of the opening and closing capital for a period of time, as opposed to only the capital figure at the end of the period.
