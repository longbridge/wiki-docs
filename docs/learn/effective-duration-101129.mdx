<p>Effective Duration is a measure of a bond or bond portfolio's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Unlike Modified Duration, Effective Duration takes into account the impact of embedded options (such as call or put options) on the bond's response to interest rate changes. It is calculated by estimating the expected change in the bond price for a small change in interest rates. The higher the Effective Duration, the more sensitive the bond is to changes in interest rates.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Effective duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond or bond portfolio to changes in interest rates. Unlike modified duration, effective duration takes into account the impact of embedded options (such as call or put options) on the bond's response to interest rate changes. It is calculated by estimating the expected change in the bond's price for a small change in interest rates. The higher the effective duration, the more sensitive the bond is to interest rate changes.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of effective duration originated in the 1980s as financial markets became more complex. Investors needed a more precise method to measure the sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes. Traditional duration calculation methods could not adequately account for the impact of embedded options, leading to the development of effective duration.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Effective duration can be categorized into two main types: 1. Effective duration of fixed-rate bonds, where the cash flows are fixed and the calculation is relatively straightforward; 2. Effective duration of bonds with embedded options, such as callable or putable bonds, where the cash flows are uncertain and the calculation is more complex. The key characteristic of effective duration is its ability to more accurately reflect the price changes of bonds in different interest rate environments, especially for bonds with embedded options.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Case 1: Suppose a company issues a callable bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a maturity of 10 years. If market interest rates rise by 1%, the price of the bond may decrease, but due to the company's right to call the bond, the price decrease might be less than that of a bond without embedded options. By calculating the effective duration, one can more accurately predict the price change. Case 2: An investor holds a portfolio of bonds with put options. If market interest rates fall, issuers might choose to defer payments, affecting the bond's cash flows. Effective duration helps the investor assess the price change in such scenarios.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How is effective duration different from modified duration? Effective duration accounts for the impact of embedded options, while modified duration does not. 2. Why is effective duration more suitable for bonds with embedded options? Because it can more accurately reflect the price changes of these bonds in different interest rate environments.</p>`} id={101129} />
