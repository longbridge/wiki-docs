<p>A Western Account is a type of joint underwriting arrangement where all participating underwriters share the responsibility of selling the securities. Each underwriter is proportionally responsible for any unsold securities. This means that if some securities remain unsold, all underwriters will collectively share the burden of these unsold securities according to their underwriting shares.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A Western Account is a type of syndicate underwriting arrangement where all participating underwriters share the responsibility of selling securities. Each underwriter is proportionally responsible for any unsold securities, meaning that if some securities remain unsold, all underwriters will share these unsold securities according to their underwriting share.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the Western Account originated in the Western United States' securities markets, first used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This method was initially developed to handle larger securities issuance projects, ensuring that all participating underwriters could share the risk.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> There are two main types of Western Accounts: fixed proportion sharing and dynamic proportion sharing.<ul><li>Fixed Proportion Sharing: Each underwriter's share is determined at the outset, and unsold securities are distributed according to this fixed proportion regardless of sales performance.</li><li>Dynamic Proportion Sharing: The underwriters' shares are adjusted based on sales performance, and unsold securities are distributed according to the adjusted proportions.</li></ul>The main characteristic of a Western Account is its risk-sharing mechanism, which effectively reduces the risk for individual underwriters while requiring a high level of cooperation and trust among them.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li>Case 1: A company plans to issue 100 million shares, with underwriters A, B, and C underwriting 40%, 35%, and 25%, respectively. If 10% of the shares remain unsold, A, B, and C will bear 4%, 3.5%, and 2.5% of the unsold shares, respectively.</li><li>Case 2: In a large bond issuance, underwriters D, E, and F use a dynamic proportion sharing method, with initial proportions of 30%, 40%, and 30%. Due to E's better sales performance, the final proportions adjust to 25%, 50%, and 25%, and the unsold bonds are distributed according to these adjusted proportions.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Q: What is the difference between a Western Account and an Eastern Account?<br/>A: A Western Account requires all underwriters to share the unsold securities, whereas an Eastern Account allows each underwriter to be responsible only for their own unsold portion.</li><li>Q: What is the main advantage of a Western Account?<br/>A: The main advantage is risk-sharing, which reduces the risk for individual underwriters and increases the likelihood of successful underwriting.</li></ul></p>`} id={101014} />
