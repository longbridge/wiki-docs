An option premium is the current market price of an option contract. It is thus the income received by the seller (writer) of an option contract to another party. In-the-money option premiums are composed of two factors: intrinsic and extrinsic value. Out-of-the-money options premiums consist solely of extrinsic value.For stock options, the premium is quoted as a dollar amount per share, and most contracts represent the commitment of 100 shares.
