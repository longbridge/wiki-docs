A phantom stock plan is an employee benefit plan that gives selected employees (senior management) many of the benefits of stock ownership without actually giving them any company stock. This type of plan is sometimes referred to as shadow stock.Rather than getting physical stock, the employee receives mock stock. Even though it's not real, the phantom stock follows the price movement of the company's actual stock, paying out any resulting profits.
