<p>The Greater Fool Theory is an investment theory that suggests an asset's price can keep rising because there will always be a "greater fool" willing to buy it at a higher price, regardless of its intrinsic value. According to this theory, investors buy assets not based on fundamental analysis or intrinsic value, but because they believe they can sell the asset to the next buyer at a higher price. This behavior is especially common during market bubbles, when market sentiment drives prices far beyond their actual value, and investors continue to chase rising prices blindly. However, when there are no longer any "greater fools" to buy the asset, the bubble bursts, leading to a rapid decline in asset prices and potentially significant losses for investors.</p>
