The term forbearance refers to the temporary postponement of loan payments, typically for a mortgage or student loan. Lenders and other creditors grant forbearance as an alternative to forcing a property into foreclosure or leaving the borrower to default.The companies that hold loans and their insurers are often willing to negotiate forbearance agreements because the losses caused by foreclosures or defaults typically fall on them.
