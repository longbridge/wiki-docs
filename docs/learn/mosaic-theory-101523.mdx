The mosaic theory refers to a method of analysis used by security analysts to gather information about a corporation. The mosaic theory involves collecting public, non-public, and non-material information about a company to determine the underlying value ofÂ its securities and to enable the analyst to make recommendations to clients based on that information.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Mosaic Theory refers to a method used by securities analysts to gather information about a company. This theory involves collecting public, non-public, and non-material information to determine the potential value of its securities, enabling analysts to make recommendations to clients based on this information.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Mosaic Theory originated in the mid-20th century as the securities market developed. Analysts realized that a single source of information was insufficient to fully assess a company's value. By integrating multiple sources of information, analysts could more accurately predict a company's future performance.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Mosaic Theory primarily involves three types of information: public information, non-public information, and non-material information.<ul><li><strong>Public Information:</strong> Includes company financial reports, press releases, industry reports, etc. This information is easily accessible but also widely known in the market.</li><li><strong>Non-public Information:</strong> Includes internal company news, supply chain information, etc. This information is usually obtained through legal channels and is not widely known in the market.</li><li><strong>Non-material Information:</strong> Includes market sentiment, the reputation of the management team, etc. This information is difficult to quantify but significantly impacts the company's long-term value.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case One:</strong> An analyst learns through public information that a tech company has released a new financial report showing revenue growth. However, through non-public information, he discovers that the company is undergoing a large-scale internal restructuring that may affect future performance. Combining non-material information, he finds that the market lacks confidence in the company's management. Therefore, he advises clients to invest cautiously.</li><li><strong>Case Two:</strong> Another analyst learns through public information that a pharmaceutical company has received approval for a new drug. Through non-public information, he learns that the company has some issues in its supply chain that may affect the production and sales of the new drug. Combining non-material information, he finds that the market is very optimistic about the company's prospects. Therefore, he advises clients to invest in the short term.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question One:</strong> Is the Mosaic Theory legal?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The Mosaic Theory itself is legal, but analysts must ensure that the non-public information they collect is obtained through legal channels and does not involve insider trading.</li><li><strong>Question Two:</strong> How to ensure the accuracy of non-material information?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The accuracy of non-material information is challenging to guarantee. Analysts need to combine multiple sources of information and make comprehensive judgments.</li></ul></p>`} id={101523} />
