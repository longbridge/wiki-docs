The term herd instinct refers to a phenomenon where people join groups and follow the actions of others under the assumption that other individuals have already done their research. Herd instincts are common in all aspects of society, even within the financial sector, where investors follow what they perceive other investors are doing, rather than relying on their own analysis.In other words, an investor who exhibits herd instinct generally gravitates toward the same or similar investments as others. Herd instinct at scale can create asset bubbles or market crashes via panic buying and panic selling.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Herd instinct refers to the phenomenon where individuals join a group and follow the actions of others, assuming that other individuals have done sufficient research. Herd instinct is common in various aspects of society, including the financial sector, where investors follow the actions of other investors rather than relying on their own analysis. In other words, investors exhibiting herd instinct tend to invest in the same or similar projects as others.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of herd instinct can be traced back to social psychology research in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon systematically explored the characteristics and impacts of group behavior in his book "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind." With the development of financial markets, the influence of herd instinct on investment behavior has gradually attracted the attention of scholars and investors.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Herd instinct can be divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Informational Conformity:</strong> When individuals believe that the group has more or better information, they choose to follow the group's actions.</li><li><strong>Normative Conformity:</strong> Individuals follow the group's actions to gain acceptance or avoid rejection.</li><li><strong>Emotional Conformity:</strong> Individuals are emotionally influenced by the group's atmosphere and act in line with the group.</li></ul><p>These types of herd instinct manifest in financial markets as collective buying or selling behaviors, which can lead to significant market volatility.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1: The Dot-com Bubble of 2000</strong><br/>In the late 1990s, the stock prices of internet companies soared, and many investors blindly followed others in buying these stocks without conducting thorough research. Eventually, the market bubble burst, resulting in significant losses for many investors.</p><p><strong>Case 2: The 2008 Financial Crisis</strong><br/>Before the subprime mortgage crisis, many investors blindly followed others in purchasing high-risk mortgage-backed securities (MBS). When the market realized the risks of these securities, collective selling led to a market crash.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>1. Does herd instinct always lead to negative outcomes?</strong><br/>Not necessarily. While herd instinct is often associated with market bubbles and crashes, it can sometimes have positive effects, such as promoting the adoption of new technologies.</p><p><strong>2. How can investors avoid the influence of herd instinct?</strong><br/>Investors should conduct independent research and analysis, avoiding blindly following others' investment decisions. Additionally, maintaining rationality and calmness, and avoiding emotional decisions are key.</p>`} id={101584} />
