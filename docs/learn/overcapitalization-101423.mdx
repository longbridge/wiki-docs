The term overcapitalization refers to a situation wherein the value of a company's capital is worth more than its total assets. Put simply, there is more debt and equity compared to the value of its assets. When a company is overcapitalized, its market value is less than its total capitalized value or its current value. An overcapitalized company may end up paying more in interest and dividend payments than it can sustain in the long term. Being overcapitalized means that a company's capital management strategies are running inefficiently, placing it in a poor financial position.
