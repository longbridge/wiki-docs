<p>Overcapitalization refers to a situation where a company's issued capital exceeds its actual asset value. This typically occurs when a company overestimates its assets or earning capacity, leading to an excessive amount of issued stocks or bonds, resulting in an unbalanced capital structure. As a consequence, the company may struggle to pay dividends or interest, as its actual earnings are insufficient to cover these payments. Overcapitalization can lead to a loss of market confidence, a decline in stock prices, and potentially a financial crisis. Addressing overcapitalization usually involves restructuring the capital, reducing equity or debt to restore financial health.</p>
