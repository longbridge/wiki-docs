Non-recurring net profit attributable to the parent company refers to the net profit attributable to the owner of the parent company after deducting non-recurring gains and losses of the enterprise. Non-recurring gains and losses refer to income, expenses, etc. that occur in the normal course of business but are unrelated to the main business or occur infrequently but are related to the main business.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-recurring net profit attributable to the parent company (NRNP) refers to the net profit attributable to the parent company's shareholders after deducting non-recurring gains and losses. Non-recurring gains and losses are those that occur during the normal course of business but are unrelated to the main business or occur infrequently.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of NRNP originated from the need for financial analysis to more accurately reflect a company's operating results. As financial statements became more complex, investors and analysts needed a method to exclude non-recurring and non-representative items to better assess a company's actual operating performance.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> NRNP can be divided into two categories: net profit after deducting non-recurring gains and losses, and net profit without such deductions. The former better reflects a company's sustainable operating capacity, while the latter may be influenced by one-time items. The characteristics of NRNP include its stability and predictability, providing a more accurate reflection of a company's operating condition.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company sells a non-core asset in a given year, resulting in a significant income. If only net profit is considered, this income would greatly enhance the company's profitability, but it does not represent the performance of the main business. By using NRNP, this non-recurring income can be excluded, providing a more accurate assessment of the company's operating condition. Case 2: A company receives an insurance payout due to a natural disaster in a given year. This payout is a non-recurring gain. If not excluded, the company's net profit would appear unusually high. By using NRNP, this payout can be excluded, providing a more realistic reflection of the company's operating results.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why use NRNP? Answer: Using NRNP can exclude non-recurring and non-representative items, providing a more accurate reflection of a company's operating condition. 2. Is NRNP completely reliable? Answer: While NRNP can exclude non-recurring gains and losses, it should still be combined with other financial indicators for a comprehensive analysis to fully understand a company's financial condition.</p>`} id={104850} />
