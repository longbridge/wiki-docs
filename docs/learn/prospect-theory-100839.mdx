Prospect theory assumes that losses and gains are valued differently, and thus individuals make decisions based on perceived gains instead of perceived losses. Also known as the "loss-aversion" theory, the general concept is that if two choices are put before an individual, both equal, with one presented in terms of potential gains and the other in terms of possible losses, the former option will be chosen.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Prospect Theory</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Prospect Theory posits that losses and gains are valued differently, leading individuals to prefer potential gains over avoiding potential losses in decision-making processes. Also known as the 'loss aversion' theory, its core idea is that given two equal choices, one framed in terms of potential gains and the other in terms of potential losses, individuals are more likely to choose the former.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>Prospect Theory was proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Through a series of experimental studies, they found that traditional expected utility theory could not explain people's actual decision-making behavior when faced with risk and uncertainty. The introduction of Prospect Theory marked a significant milestone in behavioral economics.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Prospect Theory is divided into two main stages: the editing stage and the evaluation stage. In the editing stage, individuals simplify and reframe the decision problem; in the evaluation stage, they make decisions based on the different values of potential gains and losses. A key characteristic of Prospect Theory is 'loss aversion,' meaning that people are more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains.</p><h3>Comparison with Similar Concepts</h3><p>Prospect Theory differs significantly from Expected Utility Theory. Expected Utility Theory assumes that people are rational and will choose the option that maximizes expected utility, whereas Prospect Theory suggests that people's decision-making behavior under risk is not always rational, especially in the context of weighing losses and gains.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose you have $1000, and you have two choices: A. A guaranteed gain of $500; B. A 50% chance of gaining $1000 and a 50% chance of gaining nothing. According to Prospect Theory, most people would choose A because the guaranteed gain is more attractive than the uncertain gain.</p><p>Case 2: Suppose you have $2000, and you have two choices: A. A guaranteed loss of $500; B. A 50% chance of losing $1000 and a 50% chance of losing nothing. According to Prospect Theory, most people would choose B because they prefer to avoid a certain loss, even if it means taking on more risk.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why does Prospect Theory suggest that people are more sensitive to losses than to gains?<br/>Answer: Because psychologically, the pain of losing is often felt more intensely than the pleasure of gaining an equivalent amount, a phenomenon known as 'loss aversion.'</p><p>2. How does Prospect Theory affect investment decisions?<br/>Answer: Investors may avoid high-risk, high-reward investments due to fear of losses, or they may be reluctant to cut their losses in a losing investment, leading to even greater losses.</p>`} id={100839} />
