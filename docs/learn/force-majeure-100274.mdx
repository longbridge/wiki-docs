<p>Force Majeure refers to certain events or circumstances specified in a contract that are unforeseeable, unavoidable, and insurmountable, which prevent one or both parties from fulfilling their contractual obligations. Common examples of force majeure events include natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes), wars, terrorist attacks, government actions, and strikes. When a force majeure event occurs, the affected party can invoke the force majeure clause in the contract to temporarily or permanently relieve themselves from the obligation to perform their contractual duties. The purpose of the force majeure clause is to protect the parties in a contract from legal liability when extreme and unpredictable events occur, making performance impossible.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Force majeure refers to certain events or circumstances stipulated in a contract that are unforeseeable, unavoidable, and insurmountable, making it impossible for one or both parties to fulfill their contractual obligations. Common force majeure events include natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes), wars, terrorist attacks, government actions, and strikes. When a force majeure event occurs, the affected party can temporarily or permanently be exempted from fulfilling their contractual obligations based on the force majeure clause in the contract. The purpose of the force majeure clause is to protect both parties from legal liability when facing extreme and unpredictable events.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of force majeure originates from the Roman law principle of “Act of God,” referring to natural events beyond human control. As commercial and legal systems evolved, the definition of force majeure expanded to include more types of events, such as wars and government actions. In modern contract law, force majeure clauses have become an important tool for protecting both parties in a contract.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Force majeure events can be divided into two main categories: natural events and human-made events. Natural events include natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes; human-made events include wars, terrorist attacks, government actions, and strikes. Natural events are typically sudden and unpredictable, while human-made events may have some foreseeability but are still difficult to avoid and overcome. The characteristic of force majeure clauses is their protective nature, aiming to reduce or exempt the affected party's contractual liability.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A construction company signed a contract with a client to complete a project within a year. However, during the construction process, a severe earthquake occurred, causing significant damage to the construction site and halting the work. Based on the force majeure clause in the contract, the construction company can temporarily suspend its contractual obligations until the conditions for construction are restored. Case 2: An international trading company signed a supply contract with an overseas client, but during the contract period, a war broke out in the client's country, disrupting logistics and making timely delivery impossible. According to the force majeure clause, the trading company can be exempted from liability for delayed delivery.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How to prove the occurrence of a force majeure event? Usually, relevant evidence such as government announcements and news reports is required. 2. Does the force majeure clause apply to all contracts? Not all contracts contain a force majeure clause; it depends on the specific contract terms. 3. Does the contract automatically terminate after a force majeure event? Not necessarily; usually, the obligations are temporarily suspended, and the specific situation depends on the contract terms.</p>`} id={100274} />
