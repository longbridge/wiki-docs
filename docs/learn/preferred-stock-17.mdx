Preferred stock is a type of stock that has preferential rights, and shareholders holding this stock have priority in the distribution of company profits and liquidation. Preferred stock has a higher dividend right than common stock, but usually does not have voting rights. Preferred stock usually has a fixed dividend rate and a fixed redemption period.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Preferred stock is a type of stock that grants its holders priority in profit distribution and liquidation over common stockholders. Preferred stockholders typically receive higher dividends than common stockholders but usually do not have voting rights. Preferred stocks often come with a fixed dividend rate and a fixed return period.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of preferred stock dates back to the 19th century in the United States, when railroad companies began issuing this type of stock to raise funds. Over time, preferred stock was adopted by other industries and became a common financing tool.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Preferred stock can be divided into cumulative and non-cumulative preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock features the accumulation of unpaid dividends, which must be paid in future years. Non-cumulative preferred stock does not have this feature. Additionally, there are convertible and non-convertible preferred stocks. Convertible preferred stock can be converted into common stock under certain conditions, while non-convertible preferred stock cannot.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company issues 1 million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $100 per share and an annual dividend rate of 5%. This means the company needs to pay $5 per share in dividends each year. If the company fails to pay dividends in a given year, holders of cumulative preferred stock will be compensated in the future. Case 2: An investor purchases convertible preferred stock and, after holding it for a period, notices the company's performance is strong and the stock price has risen. The investor decides to convert the preferred stock into common stock to benefit from the price increase.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What is the main difference between preferred stock and common stock? Preferred stockholders have priority in dividends and liquidation but usually do not have voting rights. 2. Why do companies issue preferred stock? Companies issue preferred stock to raise funds without diluting the equity of common stockholders, while offering fixed returns to attract investors.</p>`} id={17} />
