The new growth theory is an economic concept, positing that humans' desires and unlimited wants foster ever-increasing productivity and economic growth. It argues that real gross domestic product(GDP)per person will perpetually increase because of people's pursuit of profits.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The New Growth Theory is an economic theory that posits human desires and unlimited needs drive continuous productivity and economic growth. This theory emphasizes that technological progress, knowledge accumulation, and innovation are the main factors driving long-term economic growth. It suggests that the pursuit of profit by individuals leads to sustained growth in per capita real GDP.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The New Growth Theory originated in the 1980s, proposed by economists such as Paul Romer and Robert Lucas. They extended the traditional Solow growth model by emphasizing the role of endogenous factors (like technological progress and human capital) in economic growth.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The New Growth Theory mainly divides into two categories: endogenous growth models and exogenous growth models. Endogenous growth models emphasize that technological progress and knowledge accumulation are endogenous factors of economic growth, while exogenous growth models consider these factors as exogenous. Characteristics of the New Growth Theory include: 1. Emphasis on technological progress and innovation; 2. Importance of knowledge and human capital; 3. Impact of policies and institutions on economic growth.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. The rise of Silicon Valley in the USA: As a global center for technological innovation, Silicon Valley has attracted a large amount of high-tech talent and capital, driving technological progress and economic growth. 2. China's economic reforms: By introducing market mechanisms and encouraging innovation, China has achieved rapid economic growth and technological progress.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. How does the New Growth Theory explain economic stagnation? The New Growth Theory suggests that economic stagnation may result from a halt in technological progress and innovation. 2.
