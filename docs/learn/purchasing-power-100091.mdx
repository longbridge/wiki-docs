Based on margin requirements, they can borrow an additional 50,000 yuan for investment. This 50,000 yuan is their purchasing power.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why does purchasing power decrease?<br/>Purchasing power decreases mainly due to inflation, as rising prices reduce the amount of goods or services that one unit of currency can buy.</p><p>2. How to protect purchasing power?<br/>Investing in inflation-resistant assets such as real estate, gold, or inflation-protected bonds can help protect purchasing power.</p>`} id={100091} />
