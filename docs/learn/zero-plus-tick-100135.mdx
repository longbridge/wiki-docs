<p>A zero plus tick or zero uptick is a security trade that is executed at the same price as the preceding trade but at a higher price than the last trade of a different price. For example, if a succession of trades occurs at $10, $10.01, and $10.01 again, the latter trade would be considered a zero plus tick, or zero uptick trade, because it is the same price as the previous trade, but a higher price than the last trade at a different price.</p><p>The term zero plus tick or zero uptick can be applied to stocks, bonds, commodities, and other traded securities, but most often is used for listed equity securities. The opposite of a zero plus tick is a zero minus tick.</p>
