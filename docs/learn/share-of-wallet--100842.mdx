ShareÂ of wallet (SOW) is the dollar amount an average customer regularly devotes to a particular brand rather than to competing brands in the same product category. Companies try to maximize an existing customer's share of wallet by introducing multiple products and services to generate as much revenue as possible from each customer. A marketing campaign, for example, may have a stated goal of increasing the brand's wallet share for specific customers at the expense of its competitors.
