OPRA's two main data sources include the last reported trades of completed securities transactions and the bid and ask quotes for options.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> OPRA was established in 1975 to enhance transparency and efficiency in the options market through a unified market data system. As the options market evolved, OPRA's role expanded, becoming the primary provider of options market data.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> OPRA's data is primarily divided into two categories: 1. Last reported trades of completed securities transactions, which provide the latest trading prices and volumes in the market; 2. Bid and ask quotes for options, which show the prices at which market participants are willing to buy or sell options. OPRA's data is characterized by its real-time nature and accuracy, helping investors make more informed decisions.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. An investor, through their broker, obtains the latest options quotes provided by OPRA and notices a low bid price for a stock option, deciding to buy the option in hopes of future profit. 2. A financial institution uses OPRA's data for market analysis and discovers a significant increase in the trading volume of a certain type of option, leading them to adjust their investment portfolio.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is OPRA's data free? Answer: In most cases, OPRA's data is provided through brokers or data providers and may require a fee. 2. How real-time is OPRA's data?
