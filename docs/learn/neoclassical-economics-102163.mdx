<p>Neoclassical Economics is an economic theory that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, emphasizing the role of supply and demand in regulating markets, with individual rationality and market efficiency as foundational principles. Neoclassical economics is based on three core assumptions: rational choice, marginal analysis, and equilibrium.</p><p>Key characteristics include:</p><p>Rational Choice: Assumes individuals are rational and make decisions to maximize their self-interest.<br/>Marginal Analysis: Focuses on marginal costs and marginal benefits, asserting that economic decisions should be based on marginal changes.<br/>Equilibrium: Markets achieve equilibrium through price mechanisms, ensuring optimal resource allocation.<br/>Microeconomic Foundations: Based on microeconomics, it studies the economic behavior and interactions of individuals, households, and firms.<br/>Example of Neoclassical Economics application:<br/>Consider a product market where the price of a good is determined by supply and demand. If the price is too high, suppliers will increase supply while consumers will reduce demand, leading to a price decrease. Conversely, if the price is too low, supply will decrease and demand will increase, causing the price to rise. Eventually, the market reaches an equilibrium where supply equals demand, and resources are optimally allocated. This illustrates the neoclassical principle of price mechanism regulating the market.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Neoclassical Economics</h2><p>Neoclassical Economics is a school of economic thought that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emphasizes that markets are self-regulating through supply and demand, and that individual rationality and market efficiency are the foundations of economic behavior. Neoclassical economics is based on three core assumptions: rational choice, marginal analysis, and equilibrium state.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>Neoclassical economics originated in the late 19th century, primarily developed by economists such as William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and LÃ©on Walras. These scholars introduced the theory of marginal utility, improving the theoretical framework of classical economics and forming the basis of neoclassical economics.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The main characteristics of neoclassical economics include:</p><ul><li><strong>Rational Choice:</strong> Assumes that individuals are rational in their economic decisions, aiming to maximize their self-interest.</li><li><strong>Marginal Analysis:</strong> Focuses on the analysis of marginal costs and marginal benefits, suggesting that economic decisions should be based on marginal changes.</li><li><strong>Equilibrium State:</strong> Markets achieve supply and demand equilibrium through price mechanisms, leading to optimal resource allocation.</li><li><strong>Microeconomic Foundation:</strong> Based on microeconomics, it studies the economic behavior of individuals, households, and firms and their interactions.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: In a commodity market, the price of goods is determined by supply and demand. When the price of a commodity is too high, suppliers will increase supply, while consumer demand decreases, causing the price to fall. Conversely, when the price is too low, supply decreases, demand increases, and the price rises. Eventually, the market reaches a supply-demand balance, and resources are optimally allocated. This is the basic principle of price mechanism regulation in neoclassical economics.</p><p>Case 2: In the labor market, wage levels are determined by the supply and demand for labor. When wage levels are too high, firms reduce hiring, labor supply increases, and wage levels tend to fall. Conversely, when wage levels are too low, firms increase hiring, labor supply decreases, and wage levels rise. Eventually, the labor market reaches a supply-demand balance.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does neoclassical economics ignore market failures?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, neoclassical economics assumes markets are perfectly competitive, ignoring situations like monopolies and externalities that lead to market failures.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> How does neoclassical economics explain economic cycles?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Neoclassical economics mainly explains economic cycles through supply and demand shocks and price adjustments, but it has limitations in explaining large-scale economic fluctuations.</p>`} id={102163} />
