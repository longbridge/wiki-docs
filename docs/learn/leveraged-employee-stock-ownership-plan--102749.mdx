A leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP) is an employee compensation program in which the sponsoring company leverages its own credit and borrows the money used to fund the plan and purchase shares from the company's treasury. These shares are then used for the stock ownership plan (ESOP), with the company subsequently paying back the original loan with annual contributions.
