<p>Excess of Loss Reinsurance (XL Reinsurance) is a type of reinsurance contract where the reinsurer assumes responsibility for losses exceeding a predetermined amount incurred by the primary insurer due to a single event or a series of related events. This type of reinsurance is designed to protect the primary insurer from the risk of large payouts, ensuring financial stability. The coverage limits and trigger points of excess of loss reinsurance are clearly specified in the contract and can include forms such as per risk excess of loss, aggregate excess of loss, and catastrophe excess of loss.
