The information ratio (IR) is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. The benchmark used is typically an index that represents the market or a particular sector or industry.The IR is often used as a measure of a portfolio manager's level of skill and ability to generate excess returns relative to a benchmark, but it also attempts to identify the consistency of the performance by incorporating a tracking error, or standard deviation component into the calculation.The tracking error identifies the level of consistency in which a portfolio "tracks" the performance of an index. A low tracking error means the portfolio is beating the index consistently over time. A high tracking error means that the portfolio returns are more volatile over time and not as consistent in exceeding the benchmark.
