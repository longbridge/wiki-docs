Treasury stock refers to the shares of stock that a company repurchases but does not cancel or destroy, instead retaining them in the company's balance sheet as capital. Treasury stock typically does not have dividend or voting rights, and therefore does not affect the shareholders' equity of the company. The existence of treasury stock helps the company manage its capital structure and stock price.

Why do companies repurchase shares and retain them as treasury stock?
