Treasury stock refers to the shares of stock that a company repurchases but does not cancel or destroy, instead retaining them in the company's balance sheet as capital. Treasury stock typically does not have dividend or voting rights, and therefore does not affect the shareholders' equity of the company. The existence of treasury stock helps the company manage its capital structure and stock price.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Treasury stock refers to shares that a company has repurchased but not canceled or destroyed, instead retaining them in the company's capital balance sheet. Treasury stock typically does not enjoy dividends or voting rights, thus having no impact on shareholders' equity. The existence of treasury stock helps companies manage their capital structure and stock price.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of treasury stock originated from the need for companies to flexibly manage their capital structure. The earliest buyback activities can be traced back to the early 20th century when companies began to realize that repurchasing shares could influence market prices and shareholder value.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Treasury stock is mainly divided into two categories: planned repurchases and opportunistic repurchases. Planned repurchases are conducted regularly according to a set plan, while opportunistic repurchases occur when market conditions are favorable. Key features of treasury stock include the lack of dividends and voting rights, and the potential for future reissuance or use in employee incentive plans.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>A typical case is Apple Inc., which has conducted large-scale stock buybacks in recent years, retaining some shares as treasury stock. This strategy has helped Apple stabilize its stock price during market fluctuations and increase earnings per share. Another example is Microsoft Corporation, which also repurchases shares to adjust its capital structure and retains some as treasury stock for future use.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand that treasury stock affects shareholder equity. In reality, since treasury stock does not enjoy dividends or voting rights, it has no direct impact on existing shareholders' equity. Additionally, investors may worry that the reissuance of treasury stock will dilute shareholder value, but this usually depends on how the company manages the reissuance of these shares.</p>`} id={101} />
