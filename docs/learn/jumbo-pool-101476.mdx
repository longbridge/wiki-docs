A jumbo pool is a pass-through Ginnie Mae II mortgage-backed security (MBS) that is collateralized by multiple-issuer pools. These pools combine mortgage loans with similar characteristics and are more massive than single-issuer pools. The mortgages contained in jumbo pools are more diverse on a geographical basis than are those in single-issuer pools.
