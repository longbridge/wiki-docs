A reverse takeover (RTO) is a process whereby private companies can become publicly traded companies without going through an initial public offering (IPO).To begin, a private company buys enough shares to control a publicly-traded company. The private company's shareholder then exchanges its shares in the private company for shares in the public company. At this point, the private company has effectively become a publicly-traded company.An RTO is also sometimes referred to as a reverse merger or a reverse IPO.
