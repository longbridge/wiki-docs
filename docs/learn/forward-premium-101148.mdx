A forward premium is a situation in which the forward or expected future price for a currency is greater than the spot price. It is an indication by the market that the current domestic exchange rate is going to increase against the other currency.ThisÂ circumstance can be confusing because an increasing exchange rate means the currency is depreciating in value.
