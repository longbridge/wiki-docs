<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Diluted Earnings Per Share (Diluted EPS) is a metric used to measure the quality of a company's earnings per share, assuming all convertible securities are exercised. Diluted EPS is usually lower than simple or basic EPS. Convertible securities include outstanding convertible preferred shares, convertible bonds, options, and warrants.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Diluted EPS originated in the mid-20th century as financial markets evolved and company financing tools diversified. Investors and analysts needed a more comprehensive metric to assess a company's profitability. In the 1970s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began requiring companies to disclose Diluted EPS in financial reports to enhance financial transparency.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Diluted EPS mainly falls into two categories: Basic EPS and Diluted EPS. Basic EPS considers only the number of common shares, while Diluted EPS takes into account all securities that could potentially be converted into common shares. The characteristic of Diluted EPS is that it is more conservative, reflecting the company's profitability after all potential equity is exercised, providing a more comprehensive financial picture.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose a company has 1 million common shares and a net profit of $10 million, resulting in a Basic EPS of $10. If the company also has 100,000 convertible preferred shares, each convertible into one common share, the Diluted EPS would be $10 million divided by 1.1 million shares, approximately $9.09. Case 2: A company issues convertible bonds that can be converted into 500,000 common shares, with a net profit of $5 million and a Basic EPS of $5. The Diluted EPS would be $5 million divided by 1.5 million shares, approximately $3.33.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why is Diluted EPS usually lower than Basic EPS? Because Diluted EPS considers all potential increases in equity, the denominator increases, leading to a lower EPS. 2. How should investors use Diluted EPS? Investors should compare Diluted EPS with Basic EPS to assess the company's profitability after all potential equity is exercised.</p>`} id={102426} />
