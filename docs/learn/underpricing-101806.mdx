Underpricing is the practice of listing an initial public offering (IPO) at a price below its real value in the stock market.Â When a new stock closes its first day of trading above the set IPO price, the stock is considered to have been underpriced.Underpricing is short-lived because investor demand will drive the price upwards to its market value.
