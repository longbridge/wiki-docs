Green chip stocks are shares of environmentally-friendly companies. Green chip stocks are likely to be concentrated in areas such as alternative energy, pollution control, carbon abatement, and recycling.But despite these issues, green chip stocks may attract significant interest from investors who care about environmentally-friendly market leaders. These stocks are popular with investors who want to focus on socially responsible investing (SRI).
