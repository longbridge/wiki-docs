A pattern day trader (PDT) is a regulatory designation for those traders or investors who execute four or more day trades over the span of five business days using a margin account. The number of day trades must constitute more than 6% of the margin account’s total trade activity during that five-business-day window.If this occurs, the trader’s account will be flagged as a PDT by their broker. The PDT designation places certain restrictions on further trading; this designation is put in place to discourage investors from trading excessively.
