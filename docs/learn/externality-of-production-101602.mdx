Production externality refers to a side effect from an industrial operation, such as a paper mill producing waste that is dumped into a river. Production externalities are usually unintended, and their impacts are typically unrelated to and unsolicited by anyone. They can have economic, social, orÂ environmental side effects.Production externalities can be measured in terms of the difference between the actual cost of production of the good and the real cost of this production to society at large. The impact of production externalities can be positive or negative or a combination of both.
