<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(255,255,255)",color:"rgb(6,6,7)"}}>A Years Certain Annuity is a financial product designed for retirees, ensuring a periodic income for a set number of years, regardless of the annuitant's lifespan. This type of annuity offers income security for a defined period, contrasting with a life annuity, which provides lifetime income for the annuitant and, in some cases, their spouse. It is also known as a "period certain annuity," "annuity certain," "fixed period annuity," or "guaranteed term" or "guaranteed period annuity."</span></p>
