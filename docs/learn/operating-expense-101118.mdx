An operating expense is an expense that a business incurs through its normal business operations. Often abbreviated as OpEx, operating expenses include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, step costs, and funds allocated for research and development.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Operating Expenses (OpEx) are the costs incurred by a business during its normal operational activities. These expenses include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, wages, insurance, tiered costs, and research and development (R&D) funds.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of operating expenses developed alongside modern business management and accounting systems. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the expansion of industrial enterprises, the classification of management and operational costs became clearer, leading to the establishment of the concept of operating expenses.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Operating expenses can be divided into fixed expenses and variable expenses. Fixed expenses do not change with the level of production or sales, such as rent and wages; variable expenses change with the level of production or sales, such as inventory costs and marketing expenses. The characteristics of operating expenses are that they directly affect a company's profitability and cash flow management.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A retail company pays monthly rent for its stores, employee wages, and advertising costs, all of which are operating expenses. These expenses are necessary for the company's daily operations. Case 2: A tech company invests in R&D funds and equipment maintenance costs while developing new products, which are also operating expenses. These expenses directly impact the company's innovation capability and market competitiveness.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> Investors often ask how to effectively control operating expenses. The answer is through budget management, cost control, and improving operational efficiency. Additionally, a common misconception is confusing capital expenditures (CapEx) with operating expenses; the former is for purchasing long-term assets, while the latter is for daily operations.</p>`} id={101118} />
