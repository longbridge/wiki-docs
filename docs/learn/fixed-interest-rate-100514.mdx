A fixed interest rate is an unchanging rate charged on a liability, such as a loan or a mortgage. It might apply during the entire term of the loan or for just part of the term, but it remains the same throughout a set period. Mortgages can have multiple interest-rate options, including one that combines a fixed rate for some portion of the term and an adjustable rate for the balance. These are referred to as hybrids.
