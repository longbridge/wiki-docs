Foregone earnings represent the difference between earnings actually achieved and the earnings that could have been achieved with the absence of fees, expenses, or lost time. As such, a large portion of foregone is represented by the amount that the investor spent on investment fees, which often make up a sizable percentage of investment earnings.The assumption is that if the investor had been exposed to lower fees, they would have automatically earned a better return. The concept of foregone earnings is typically used when referring to sales charges, management fees, or total expenses paid to funds.
