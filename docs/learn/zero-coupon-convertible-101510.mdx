<AIContent content={`<h2>Zero-Coupon Convertible Bonds</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Zero-coupon convertible bonds are a type of fixed-income instrument that combines the characteristics of zero-coupon bonds and convertible bonds. Due to the zero-coupon feature, the bonds do not pay interest and are issued at a discount. The convertible feature means that bondholders have the right to convert the bonds into the issuer's common stock at a predetermined conversion price.</h3><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of zero-coupon convertible bonds originated in the 1980s when financial markets were continuously innovating, and both investors and issuers were seeking new financing and investment tools. The combination of zero-coupon bonds and convertible bonds provided companies with a flexible financing method and offered investors potential capital appreciation opportunities.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Zero-coupon convertible bonds are mainly divided into two categories: mandatory convertible bonds and optional convertible bonds. Mandatory convertible bonds must be converted into stock at maturity, while optional convertible bonds allow holders to choose whether to convert under specific conditions. The main characteristics of zero-coupon convertible bonds include: 1. Zero-coupon: No periodic interest payments, issued at a discount; 2. Convertible: Holders have the right to convert the bonds into stock; 3. Discount issuance: Bonds are usually issued at a price below face value due to the lack of interest payments.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A tech company issues a batch of zero-coupon convertible bonds with a face value of 1000 yuan, an issue price of 800 yuan, and a conversion price of 50 yuan per share. After purchasing, if the company's stock price rises to 60 yuan in the future, investors can choose to convert the bonds into 20 shares (1000 yuan/50 yuan), thus gaining capital appreciation. Case 2: A retail company issues zero-coupon convertible bonds with a face value of 500 yuan, an issue price of 400 yuan, and a conversion price of 25 yuan per share. If the company's stock price rises to 30 yuan in the future, investors can choose to convert the bonds into 20 shares (500 yuan/25 yuan), thus gaining capital appreciation.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. What are the main risks of zero-coupon convertible bonds? The main risks include the company's stock price falling, reducing the conversion value, and the risk of company default. 2. What is the difference between zero-coupon convertible bonds and regular convertible bonds? Zero-coupon convertible bonds do not pay interest, while regular convertible bonds typically pay periodic interest.</p>`} id={101510} />
