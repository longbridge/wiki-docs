Income elasticity of demand refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded for a certain good to a change in the real income of consumers who buy this good.The formula for calculating income elasticity of demand is the percent change in quantity demanded divided by the percent change in income. With income elasticity of demand, you can tell if a particular good represents a necessity or a luxury.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Income elasticity of demand refers to the sensitivity of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in the actual income of consumers purchasing that good. The formula for calculating income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. By understanding income elasticity of demand, one can determine whether a good is a necessity or a luxury.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of income elasticity of demand was first introduced by British economist Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century. He discovered that the demand for different goods responds differently to changes in income, leading to the introduction of this concept.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Income elasticity of demand can be divided into three categories:<ul><li>Positive income elasticity: When income increases, the quantity demanded also increases. These goods are typically luxuries, such as high-end watches and luxury cars.</li><li>Negative income elasticity: When income increases, the quantity demanded decreases. These goods are typically inferior goods, such as cheap food.</li><li>Zero income elasticity: Changes in income have no effect on the quantity demanded. These goods are typically necessities, such as basic medicines and tap water.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: Suppose a consumer's income increases by 10%, and their demand for high-end watches increases by 20%. In this case, the income elasticity of demand for high-end watches is 20%/10%=2, indicating that high-end watches are luxuries.</li><li>Case 2: Suppose a consumer's income increases by 10%, and their demand for cheap food decreases by 5%. In this case, the income elasticity of demand for cheap food is -5%/10%=-0.5, indicating that cheap food is an inferior good.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>Question: Is income elasticity of demand always positive?<br/>Answer: Not necessarily. The income elasticity of demand for luxuries is positive, while it is negative for inferior goods.</li><li>Question: How can one determine whether a good is a necessity or a luxury?<br/>Answer: By calculating the income elasticity of demand. If the elasticity is greater than 1, it is a luxury; if it is less than 1 but greater than 0, it is a necessity; if it is negative, it is an inferior good.</li></ul></p>`} id={102438} />
