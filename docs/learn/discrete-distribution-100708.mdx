A discrete distribution is a probability distribution that depicts the occurrence of discrete (individually countable) outcomes, such as 1, 2, 3, yes, no, true, or false. The binomial distribution, for example, is a discrete distribution that evaluates the probability of a "yes" or "no" outcome occurring over a given number of trials, given the event's probability in each trialâ€”such as flipping a coin one hundred times and having the outcome be "heads."Statistical distributions can be either discrete or continuous. A continuous distribution is built from outcomes that fall on a continuum, such as all numbers greater than 0 (including numbers whose decimals continue indefinitely, such as pi = 3.14159265...). Overall, the concepts of discrete and continuous probability distributions and the random variables they describe are the underpinnings of probability theory and statistical analysis.
