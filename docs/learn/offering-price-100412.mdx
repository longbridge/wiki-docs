An offering price, generally, is the price at which something is offered for sale. In finance and investments, the offering price most often refers to the per-share value at which publicly-issued securities are made available for purchase by the investment bank during an initial public offering (IPO).Underwriters analyze numerous factors when attempting to determine the ideal price for a security's offering. The underwriter's fee and any management fees applicable to the issue are typically included in the price.
