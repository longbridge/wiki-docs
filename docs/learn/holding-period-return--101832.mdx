Holding period return is the total return received from holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a period of time, known as the holding period. It is generally expressed as a percentage and is particularly useful for comparing returns on investments purchased at different periods in time.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Holding Period Return (HPR) refers to the total return earned from holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a specific period. This return is usually expressed as a percentage and is particularly useful for comparing the returns of investments made at different times.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Holding Period Return originated from investment return analysis in finance. As financial markets developed, investors needed a simple and effective way to measure the performance of different investments over various time periods, leading to the emergence of HPR.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> HPR can be divided into the holding period return of a single asset and that of a portfolio of assets. The calculation for a single asset's HPR is relatively straightforward, typically considering the initial price, ending price, and any income received (such as dividends or interest) during the period. The HPR for a portfolio requires considering the weights and returns of each asset. The characteristics of HPR include its intuitiveness and ease of understanding, making it suitable for analyzing both short-term and long-term investment returns.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose you purchase a stock for $100 on January 1, 2023, and sell it for $120 on January 1, 2024, while receiving $5 in dividends during the period. The HPR for this stock would be [(120 - 100 + 5) / 100] * 100% = 25%. Case 2: Suppose you hold a portfolio consisting of two stocks, Stock A with an HPR of 20% and a weight of 60%, and Stock B with an HPR of 10% and a weight of 40%. The HPR for the entire portfolio would be (20% * 60%) + (10% * 40%) = 16%.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Does HPR consider inflation? Typically, HPR does not account for inflation, but investors can adjust their calculations to include inflation factors. 2. Is HPR applicable to all types of investments? HPR is applicable to most types of investments, but for some complex financial instruments, more sophisticated calculation methods may be required.</p>`} id={101832} />
