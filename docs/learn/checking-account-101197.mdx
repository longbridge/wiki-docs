A checking account is a deposit account that allows you to easily make withdrawals, deposits, and fund transfers. Also called demand accounts or transactional accounts, checking accounts can be accessed using checks, automated teller machines (ATMs), and electronic debits, among other methods. They are often used to keep money for short-term expenses.
