<AIContent content={`<h2>Over-The-Counter (OTC) Trading</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Over-The-Counter (OTC) trading refers to the process of trading securities through a broker-dealer network rather than a centralized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. OTC trading can involve stocks, bonds, and derivatives, which are financial contracts deriving their value from underlying assets such as commodities. When companies do not meet the listing requirements of standard markets like the NYSE, their securities can be traded OTC but may still be subject to some regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of OTC trading originated in the early 20th century when many companies could not meet the stringent listing requirements of centralized exchanges. Over time, the OTC market has grown significantly, becoming an important financing channel for many small and medium-sized enterprises and emerging markets. Key events include the introduction of electronic trading systems in the 1970s, which greatly improved the efficiency and transparency of OTC trading.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>OTC trading can be categorized into the following types:</p><ul><li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Mainly involves stocks of companies not listed on centralized exchanges.
