Over-the-counter (OTC) is the process of trading securities via a broker-dealer network as opposed to on a centralized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange.Over-the-counter trading can involve stocks, bonds, and derivatives, which are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset such as a commodity.When companies do not meet the requirements to list on a standard market exchange such as the NYSE, their securities can be traded OTC but may still be subject to some regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
