<p>Roy's safety-first criterion is an approach to investment decisions that sets a minimum required return for a given level of risk. Roy's safety-first criterion allows investors to compare potential portfolio investments based on the probability that the portfolio returns will fall below their minimum desired return threshold.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Roy's Safety-First Criterion is an investment decision-making method that aims to manage investment risk by setting a minimum required return rate. This criterion allows investors to compare the probability that the portfolio return will fall below a minimum expected return threshold, thereby selecting a less risky portfolio.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> Roy's Safety-First Criterion was proposed by economist A.D. Roy in 1952. Roy introduced this criterion in his paper to help investors make safer investment decisions in the face of uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Roy's Safety-First Criterion can be divided into the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Absolute Safety-First Criterion:</strong> Sets an absolute minimum return rate, and investors choose portfolios with returns above this value.</li><li><strong>Relative Safety-First Criterion:</strong> Sets a relative minimum return rate, usually based on the market average return rate or risk-free rate.</li></ul>Its characteristics include:<ul><li>Emphasis on risk management, especially avoiding extreme losses.</li><li>Suitable for risk-averse investors.</li><li>Uses probability analysis to select portfolios.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose Investor A sets a minimum required return rate of 5%. He has two investment options: Portfolio X with an expected return rate of 8% and a standard deviation of 4%; Portfolio Y with an expected return rate of 10% and a standard deviation of 6%. According to Roy's Safety-First Criterion, Investor A will calculate the probability that each portfolio's return will fall below 5% and choose the one with the lower probability.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Investor B sets a minimum required return rate of 3%. He has three investment options: Portfolio A with an expected return rate of 7% and a standard deviation of 3%; Portfolio B with an expected return rate of 6% and a standard deviation of 2%; Portfolio C with an expected return rate of 5% and a standard deviation of 1%. Investor B will calculate the probability that each portfolio's return will fall below 3% and choose the one with the lowest probability.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How to determine the minimum required return rate?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The minimum required return rate is usually determined based on the investor's risk tolerance, financial goals, and market conditions.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is Roy's Safety-First Criterion suitable for all types of investors?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> This criterion is mainly suitable for risk-averse investors and not for risk-seeking investors.</li></ul></p>`} id={102665} />
