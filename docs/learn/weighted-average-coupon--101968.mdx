The weighted average coupon (WAC) is a measurement of the rate of return on a pool of mortgages that is sold to investors as a mortgage-backed security (MBS). The underlying mortgages are repaid at different lengths of time, so the WAC represents its return at the time it was issued and may differ from its WAC later.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Weighted Average Coupon (WAC) measures the return rate of a pool of mortgages sold to investors in the form of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). WAC is calculated by considering the coupon rate of each mortgage and its weight in the entire loan pool.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of WAC originated in the 1970s when the U.S. government began issuing MBS to promote the housing market. As the MBS market developed, investors needed a way to measure the return rate of these securities, leading to the introduction of WAC.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> WAC is primarily used in the MBS market but can also apply to other types of Asset-Backed Securities (ABS). Its characteristics include: 1. Reflecting the overall return rate of the loan pool; 2. Considering the coupon rates and weights of different loans; 3. Potentially changing over time as loan repayments affect the WAC.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Suppose an MBS pool contains three loans with coupon rates of 4%, 5%, and 6%, and amounts of $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million, respectively. The WAC is calculated as follows: WAC = (4%*$1M + 5%*$2M + 6%*$3M) / ($1M + $2M + $3M) = 5.33%. Case 2: If one of the loans is prepaid, say the 5% loan is prepaid by $1 million, the new WAC is calculated as follows: WAC = (4%*$1M + 5%*$1M + 6%*$3M) / ($1M + $1M + $3M) = 5.5%.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why does WAC change? Because prepayments or defaults of loans affect the composition of the loan pool, thus impacting the WAC. 2. How is WAC different from the coupon rate? The coupon rate is the interest rate of a single loan, while WAC is the weighted average interest rate of the entire loan pool.</p>`} id={101968} />
