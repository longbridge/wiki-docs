<p>Gross profit is the profit a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. Gross profit will appear on a company's income statement and can be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue (sales). These figures can be found on a company's income statement. Gross profit may also be referred to as sales profit.</p>
