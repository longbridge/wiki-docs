As companies grew in size and complexity, the AGM alone could not meet all decision-making needs, leading to the emergence of EGMs. Historically, the first records of EGMs date back to the late 19th century when corporate laws were being refined, and shareholders' rights and corporate governance structures were becoming more defined.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The main characteristics of an EGM include:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-regular:</strong> An EGM is not a regular annual meeting but a temporary meeting convened as needed.</li><li><strong>Specific Agenda:</strong> The meeting addresses and resolves specific urgent or significant matters.</li><li><strong>Convening Method:</strong> The meeting is convened by the board of directors, shareholders, or other authorized entities according to the company's articles of association or legal provisions.</li><li><strong>Legal Effect:</strong> The resolutions passed at an EGM have legal effect, equivalent to those passed at an AGM.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose a publicly traded company receives a takeover offer and needs to make a decision quickly.
