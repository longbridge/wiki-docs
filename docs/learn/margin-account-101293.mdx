The term margin account refers to a brokerage account in which a trader's broker-dealer lends them cash to purchase stocks or other financial products. The margin account and the securities held within it are used as collateral for the loan. It comes with a periodic interest rate that the investor must pay to keep it active. Borrowing money from a broker-dealer through a margin account allows investors to increase their purchasing and trading power. Investing with margin accounts means using leverage, which increases the chance of magnifying an investor's profits and losses.
