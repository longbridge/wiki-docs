<p>Delta Neutral is an investment strategy aimed at reducing or eliminating the impact of price movements of the underlying asset on the value of the investment portfolio by making the portfolio's Delta value close to zero. Delta is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of an option to changes in the price of the underlying asset, typically expressed as a value between -1 and 1.<br/>In a Delta Neutral strategy, an investor holds both the underlying asset and a corresponding number of options (or other derivatives) such that the overall Delta value of the portfolio is zero or near zero. This way, when the price of the underlying asset changes, the overall value of the portfolio experiences minimal change, thereby reducing market risk.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Delta neutral is an investment strategy aimed at reducing or eliminating the impact of price fluctuations of the underlying asset on the value of the investment portfolio by hedging to make the portfolio's Delta value close to zero. Delta is a measure of the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset, usually expressed as a number between -1 and 1.</p><p>In a delta neutral strategy, investors hold both the underlying asset and a corresponding number of options (or other derivatives) to make the entire portfolio's Delta value zero or close to zero. This way, when the price of the underlying asset changes, the overall value of the portfolio changes less, thereby reducing market risk.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The origin of the delta neutral strategy can be traced back to the 1970s when derivative trading began to emerge in financial markets. With the development of option pricing models (such as the Black-Scholes model), investors started using these models to hedge risks, and the delta neutral strategy gradually became widely used.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Delta neutral strategies are mainly divided into two categories: static delta neutral and dynamic delta neutral.</p><ul><li><strong>Static Delta Neutral:</strong> Investors set the portfolio's Delta value initially and keep it unchanged throughout the investment period. This method is simple but may require frequent adjustments when the price of the underlying asset fluctuates significantly.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Delta Neutral:</strong> Investors continuously adjust the portfolio's Delta value based on changes in the price of the underlying asset to keep it close to zero. This method is more complex but can hedge risks more effectively.</li></ul><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case One:</strong> Suppose an investor holds 100 shares of a company's stock and simultaneously sells a corresponding number of call options, making the entire portfolio's Delta value zero. When the stock price rises, the value of the options decreases, offsetting the gains from the stock price increase; and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Case Two:</strong> An investor holds a long position in an underlying asset and simultaneously buys a corresponding number of put options, making the entire portfolio's Delta value close to zero. When the price of the underlying asset falls, the value of the options increases, offsetting the losses from the price drop of the underlying asset.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the delta neutral strategy completely eliminate risk?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The delta neutral strategy mainly reduces the risk brought by price fluctuations of the underlying asset but cannot completely eliminate all risks, such as market liquidity risk and credit risk.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the delta neutral strategy suitable for all investors?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The delta neutral strategy is relatively complex and suitable for investors with certain financial knowledge and experience. Beginners may need more learning and practice to apply it effectively.</p>`} id={101156} />
