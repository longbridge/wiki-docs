<p>Capital Expenditure (Capex) refers to the funds a company spends on acquiring, maintaining, or improving its fixed assets, such as buildings, machinery, equipment, or technology. These expenditures are considered investments in the long-term growth and productive capacity of the business.&nbsp;</p><p>Capex is typically categorized as a capital budget item, which is a significant purchase that contributes to the company's value over time. It is distinct from operational expenses, which cover the ongoing costs of running a business, such as salaries, rent, and utilities. Capex is often used to expand a company's capabilities, modernize its facilities, or increase its production capacity.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Capital Expenditure (CapEx) refers to the funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. In accounting, capital expenditures are not fully expensed in the year they are incurred but are instead capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of capital expenditure originated in accounting as businesses expanded during the Industrial Revolution, necessitating investments in long-term assets to support production and operations. The accounting treatment of capital expenditures became standardized in the early 20th century to more accurately reflect a company's financial position.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Capital expenditures can be categorized into two main types: expenditures for acquiring new assets, such as machinery, land, and buildings, and expenditures for improving and maintaining existing assets to extend their useful life or enhance their productivity. The main features of capital expenditures are their long-term nature and their impact on future earnings. The advantages include increased production capacity and competitiveness, while the disadvantages involve significant capital requirements and long payback periods.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>A typical example is Apple's significant capital expenditure on its new headquarters, Apple Park. This investment not only enhanced the company's brand image but also provided a better working environment for employees. Another example is Tesla's capital expenditure on its Gigafactory, which significantly increased its battery production capacity, supporting the expansion of its electric vehicle business.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face when applying the concept of capital expenditure include accurately predicting the payback period of capital expenditures and correctly reflecting them in financial statements. A common misconception is confusing capital expenditures with operating expenses, the latter being the costs required for day-to-day operations, typically expensed in the year incurred.</p>`} id={200000} />
