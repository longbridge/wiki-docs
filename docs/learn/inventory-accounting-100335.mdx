<p>Inventory Accounting refers to the process by which a company manages its inventory through classification, valuation, counting, impairment, and write-off procedures. Inventory includes raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, and merchandise. The primary objective of inventory accounting is to ensure that the value of inventory reflected in the financial statements accurately represents its market value, thereby providing precise financial information. Common inventory valuation methods include First-In, First-Out (FIFO), Last-In, First-Out (LIFO), and the Weighted Average Cost method. Additionally, companies need to periodically conduct physical inventory counts to verify that the recorded inventory matches the actual inventory on hand, and to perform impairment adjustments based on the actual condition of the inventory.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Inventory accounting refers to the process by which a company classifies, values, counts, writes down, and writes off its inventory. Inventory includes raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, and merchandise. The main purpose of inventory accounting is to ensure that the value of inventory in the financial statements accurately reflects its market value, thereby providing accurate financial information. Common inventory valuation methods include First-In, First-Out (FIFO), Last-In, First-Out (LIFO), and Weighted Average Cost. Additionally, companies need to periodically count their inventory to verify that the book records match the actual inventory quantities and make write-downs based on the actual condition of the inventory.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of inventory accounting can be traced back to early commercial activities when merchants needed to record and manage their stock of goods. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the scale of enterprises expanded, making inventory management more complex. Inventory accounting gradually developed into an independent discipline. In the early 20th century, with the establishment and improvement of accounting standards, the theory and practice of inventory accounting further developed.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Inventory accounting mainly includes the following valuation methods:<ul><li><strong>First-In, First-Out (FIFO):</strong> Assumes that the earliest purchased inventory is sold first, and the remaining inventory is valued at the most recent purchase prices. The advantage is that the cost is closer to the current market price, but it may result in higher tax burdens during inflationary periods.</li><li><strong>Last-In, First-Out (LIFO):</strong> Assumes that the most recently purchased inventory is sold first, and the remaining inventory is valued at the earliest purchase prices. The advantage is that it can reduce tax burdens during inflationary periods, but it may lead to undervaluation of inventory.</li><li><strong>Weighted Average Cost:</strong> Averages the cost of all purchased inventory to calculate an average cost. The advantage is that it smooths out price fluctuations, but it may not reflect the latest market prices.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A manufacturing company uses the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method for inventory valuation. During a quarter, the company purchased three batches of raw materials at prices of 100, 110, and 120 units respectively. By the end of the quarter, the company sold two batches of raw materials, leaving one batch with a book value of 120 units.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A retail company uses the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method for inventory valuation. During a quarter, the company purchased three batches of merchandise at prices of 200, 210, and 220 units respectively. By the end of the quarter, the company sold two batches of merchandise, leaving one batch with a book value of 200 units.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why do different inventory valuation methods affect a company's financial statements?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Different inventory valuation methods affect the book value of inventory and the cost of goods sold, thereby impacting the company's profit and tax burden. For example, the FIFO method results in higher profits and tax burdens during inflationary periods, while the LIFO method does the opposite.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How should a company choose the appropriate inventory valuation method?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> A company should choose the appropriate inventory valuation method based on its operating environment, market conditions, and financial goals. For example, in industries with significant price fluctuations, the weighted average cost method may be more suitable.</li></ul></p>`} id={100335} />
