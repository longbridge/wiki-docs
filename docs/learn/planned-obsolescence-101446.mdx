<p>Planned obsolescence is a business strategy where products are designed and manufactured with a deliberately limited lifespan, compelling consumers to purchase new replacements after the old ones become obsolete. This strategy aims to increase sales and profits by shortening the product lifecycle. Planned obsolescence can be achieved through various means, such as:</p><p>Technical Obsolescence: Products become outdated due to technological advancements that render them incompatible with new technologies.<br/>Functional Obsolescence: Key components of a product are intentionally designed to fail after a certain period.<br/>Psychological Obsolescence: Marketing and advertising create a perception among consumers that their old products are out of date, prompting them to buy new ones.<br/>This strategy is common in many industries, including electronics, household appliances, and fashion. While planned obsolescence can drive economic growth, it also raises issues such as environmental pollution and resource waste, and has been criticized by consumers and environmental organizations.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>Planned obsolescence is a business strategy where products are designed and manufactured with a deliberately limited lifespan, encouraging consumers to purchase new replacements after the product fails. This strategy increases sales and profits by shortening the product's usage cycle.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of planned obsolescence dates back to the early 20th century, particularly during the 1920s with the Phoebus Cartel, which limited the lifespan of light bulbs to increase sales and maximize profits. Over time, this strategy has been applied to various industries.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Technical Obsolescence:</strong> Products become technologically outdated and incompatible with new technologies. For example, older smartphones may not support the latest software updates.<br/>2. <strong>Functional Obsolescence:</strong> Key components of the product are deliberately designed to fail after a certain period. For instance, printer cartridges may stop working after printing a specific number of pages.<br/>3. <strong>Psychological Obsolescence:</strong> Marketing and advertising make consumers believe that their old products are outdated, creating a desire to purchase new ones. For example, the fashion industry constantly introduces new styles to attract consumers.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Smartphones:</strong> Many smartphone manufacturers release new models annually and stop providing software updates for older models. This makes older phones gradually lag in functionality and performance, prompting consumers to buy new ones.<br/>2. <strong>Home Appliances:</strong> Some home appliances, such as washing machines and refrigerators, often break down after a few years of use. The high cost of repairs leads consumers to buy new products instead of fixing the old ones.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Is planned obsolescence illegal?</strong> In most countries, planned obsolescence is not illegal, but it raises many ethical and environmental concerns.<br/>2. <strong>How to deal with planned obsolescence?</strong> Consumers can choose to buy more durable products or support brands that offer long-term warranties and repair services.</p>`} id={101446} />
