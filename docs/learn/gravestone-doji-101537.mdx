The term gravestone doji refers to a bearish indicator commonly used in trading by technical analysts. A gravestone doji is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that is formed when the open, low, and closing prices are all near each other with a long upper shadow. The long upper shadow suggests that the bullish advance at the beginning of the session was overcome by bears by the end of the session. This often comes just before a longer-term bearish downtrend.
