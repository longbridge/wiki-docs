<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(255,255,255)",color:"rgb(6,6,7)"}}>A Price-Weighted Index is a type of stock index where the weight of each constituent company is proportional to its stock's price per share. The index is calculated by summing the prices of all the constituent stocks and dividing by the total number of constituent stocks. Consequently, higher-priced stocks have a more significant impact on the index.</span></p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>A price-weighted index is a stock index where each company's weight in the index is proportional to its stock price per share. The index is calculated by adding up the prices of all constituent stocks and then dividing by the total number of constituents. Therefore, stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The concept of a price-weighted index dates back to the late 19th century. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the most famous price-weighted indices, created by Charles Dow and Edward Jones in 1896. Initially, the index included 12 stocks, which later expanded to 30.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>Price-weighted indices have the following characteristics:<br/>1. <strong>Simple to Understand:</strong> The calculation method is relatively simple, requiring only the addition of stock prices and division by the total number of stocks.<br/>2. <strong>Price Sensitive:</strong> Stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index, which can lead to significant volatility.<br/>3. <strong>Ignores Market Capitalization:</strong> Unlike market-cap-weighted indices, price-weighted indices do not consider the size of a company's market capitalization.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA):</strong> This is one of the most famous price-weighted indices, comprising 30 large U.S. companies. Due to its calculation method, stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index. For example, a significant price change in one stock can substantially affect the entire index.<br/>2. <strong>Nikkei 225 Index:</strong> This is a Japanese price-weighted index that includes 225 stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Similar to the DJIA, stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the Nikkei 225 Index.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Why does a price-weighted index ignore market capitalization?</strong><br/>The design of a price-weighted index aims for simplicity, thus it only considers stock prices and not market capitalization.<br/>2. <strong>What are the drawbacks of a price-weighted index?</strong><br/>Since stocks with higher prices have a greater impact, this can lead to significant volatility and may not fully reflect the overall market performance.</p>`} id={101972} />
