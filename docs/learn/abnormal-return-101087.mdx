An abnormal return describes the unusually large profits or losses generated by a given investment or portfolio over a specified period. The performance diverges from the investments' expected, or anticipated, rate of return (RoR)â€”the estimated risk-adjusted return based on an asset pricing model, or using a long-run historical average or multiple valuation techniques.Returns that are abnormal may simply be anomalous or they may point to something more nefarious such as fraud or manipulation. Abnormal returns should not be confused with "alpha" or excess returns earned by actively managed investments.
