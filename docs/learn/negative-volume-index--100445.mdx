<p>The Negative Volume Index (NVI) is a technical analysis tool used to measure price movements when trading volume decreases. Developed by Paul L. Dysart in the 1930s, the NVI aims to identify changes in market trends. The underlying assumption of the NVI is that most investors act when trading volume decreases, while professional investors trade when volume increases. Therefore, the NVI focuses on price movements during periods of declining volume to determine market trends.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Negative Volume Index (NVI) is a technical analysis tool used to measure price movements when market volume decreases. Developed by Paul Desmond in the 1930s, the NVI aims to identify changes in market trends. The NVI assumes that most investors act when volume decreases, while professional investors trade when volume increases. Therefore, the NVI focuses on price movements during periods of decreasing volume to judge market trends.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Negative Volume Index was developed by Paul Desmond in the 1930s. Desmond observed that changes in market volume could provide important information about market trends, especially during periods of decreasing volume. By analyzing these changes, he developed the NVI to help investors better understand market dynamics.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The NVI mainly has two types: Simple Negative Volume Index and Weighted Negative Volume Index. The Simple NVI directly calculates price movements during periods of decreasing volume, while the Weighted NVI weights the calculations based on the extent of volume changes. The Simple NVI is suitable for beginners due to its straightforward calculation method, while the Weighted NVI is more suitable for experienced investors as it provides more precise market trend analysis.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Over a certain period, the trading volume of a stock continuously decreases, but the price rises. By analyzing the NVI, investors can determine that this is a potential market reversal signal, possibly indicating an upcoming price drop. Case 2: In another period, the trading volume of a stock decreases, and the price also falls. The NVI shows a pessimistic market sentiment, and investors might consider selling the stock to avoid further losses.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Is the NVI applicable to all markets? The NVI is mainly applicable to the stock market but can also be used in other markets where volume data is available. 2. How to deal with misjudgments by the NVI? Investors should combine other technical analysis tools, such as moving averages and the relative strength index, to improve the accuracy of their judgments.</p>`} id={100445} />
