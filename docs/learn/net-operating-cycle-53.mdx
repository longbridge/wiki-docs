Net operating cycle refers to the average time it takes for a company to complete one production and business activity. The net operating cycle includes the entire process from raw material procurement to product sales receipt. It is an important indicator for measuring the operational efficiency and capital turnover ability of a company. Generally speaking, the shorter the net operating cycle, the higher the operational efficiency of the company.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The net operating cycle refers to the average time required for a company to complete one production and business activity. It covers the entire process from raw material procurement to product sales and collection. The net operating cycle is an important indicator of a company's operational efficiency and capital turnover capability.

By the mid-20th century, with the development of management science, the net operating cycle gradually became an important tool for evaluating a company's operational efficiency.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The net operating cycle can be divided into three main stages: procurement cycle, production cycle, and sales cycle.<ul><li><strong>Procurement Cycle:</strong> The time from raw material procurement to raw material storage. This stage is characterized by the need for effective supply chain management.</li><li><strong>Production Cycle:</strong> The time from raw material storage to the completion of product production. The length of the production cycle depends on the production process and efficiency.</li><li><strong>Sales Cycle:</strong> The time from the completion of product production to the collection of product sales. The length of the sales cycle is influenced by market demand and sales strategies.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A manufacturing company's net operating cycle is 60 days, with a procurement cycle of 15 days, a production cycle of 20 days, and a sales cycle of 25 days.
