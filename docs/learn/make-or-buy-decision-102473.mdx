A make-or-buy decision is an act of choosing between manufacturing a product in-house or purchasing it from an external supplier.Also referred to as an outsourcing decision, a make-or-buy decision compares the costs and benefits associated with producing a necessary good or service internally to the costs and benefits involved in hiring an outside supplier for the resources in question.To compare costs accurately, a company must considerÂ all aspects regarding the acquisition and storage of the items versus creating the items in-house, which may require the purchase of new equipment, as well as storage costs.
