<p>Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) are financial instruments created by pooling together various types of assets, such as loans, leases, accounts receivable, etc., and then issuing securities backed by these assets. The cash flows generated by the underlying assets are used to pay interest and principal on the ABS. There are various types of ABS, including auto loan-backed securities, credit card debt-backed securities, and student loan-backed securities. ABS allows financial institutions to remove assets from their balance sheets, thereby freeing up capital and improving liquidity.</p>
