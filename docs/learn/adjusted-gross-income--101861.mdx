Adjusted gross income (AGI) is the figure that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses to determine your income tax liability for the year. It is calculated by subtracting certain adjustments from gross income, such as business expenses, student loan interest payments, and other expenses. After calculating a taxpayerâ€™s AGI, the next step is to subtract deductions to determine their taxable income.The IRS also uses other income metrics, such as modified AGI (MAGI), for specific programs and retirement accounts.
