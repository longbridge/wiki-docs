<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(255,255,255)",color:"rgb(6,6,7)"}}>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is the financial metric used by tax authorities to establish an individual's or a business's income tax liability. To calculate AGI, certain adjustable items such as business expenses and student loan interest are subtracted from the gross income. After AGI is determined, deductions are subtracted from it to find the taxable income. Additionally, the IRS utilizes other income metrics like Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for specific tax programs and retirement accounts.</span></p>
