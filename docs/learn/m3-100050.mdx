M3 is a measure of the money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements (repo), and larger liquid assets.The M3 measurement includes assets that are less liquid than other components of the money supply and are referred to as "near money," which are more closely related to the finances of larger financial institutions and corporations than to those of small businesses and individuals.
