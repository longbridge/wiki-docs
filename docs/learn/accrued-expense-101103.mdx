An accrued expense, also known as accrued liabilities, is an accounting term that refers to an expense that is recognized on the books before it has been paid. The expense is recorded in the accounting period in which it is incurred. Accrual accounting is the generally accepted accounting practice's (GAAP) preferred accounting method.
