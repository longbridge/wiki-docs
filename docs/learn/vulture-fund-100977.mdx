A vulture fund is an investment fund that seeks out and buys securities in distressed investments, such as high-yield bonds in or near default, or equities that are in or near bankruptcy. The goal is to 'swoop in' and pick up underpriced shares that are perceived to have been oversold to make high-risk but potentially high-reward bets.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>A vulture fund is an investment fund that specializes in purchasing distressed assets. These assets typically include high-yield bonds nearing default, stocks of bankrupt companies, or other undervalued assets. The goal of a vulture fund is to buy these assets at low prices and achieve high returns through restructuring or market recovery.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of vulture funds originated in the 1980s when some investors began focusing on purchasing the debt and stocks of distressed companies. These investors were called 'vultures' because, like vultures, they sought to exploit the 'carrion' of the marketâ€”assets abandoned by other investors.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Vulture funds can be categorized into the following types:</p><ul><li><strong>Distressed Debt Funds:</strong> Focus on purchasing debt that is nearing default or already in default.</li><li><strong>Bankrupt Stock Funds:</strong> Focus on purchasing stocks of bankrupt or near-bankrupt companies.</li><li><strong>Special Situation Funds:</strong> Focus on other types of distressed assets, such as assets involved in legal disputes or other undervalued assets.</li></ul><p>These funds are characterized by high risk, high return, and long investment cycles. Due to the high risk of these assets, investors need to have a strong risk tolerance and professional knowledge.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> During the 2008 financial crisis, a vulture fund purchased a large amount of distressed debt from banks and real estate companies at low prices. As the market recovered, the value of this debt increased significantly, and the fund achieved substantial returns.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A vulture fund purchased the stocks and debt of a large retail company after it declared bankruptcy. By actively participating in the company's restructuring and management, the company eventually returned to profitability, and the fund achieved high returns.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> How high is the investment risk of vulture funds?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The investment risk of vulture funds is very high because they focus on distressed assets, whose future value is highly uncertain.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Can ordinary investors invest in vulture funds?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Generally, vulture funds have high requirements for investors, including high capital thresholds and professional knowledge, making it difficult for ordinary investors to participate directly.</p>`} id={100977} />
