The phrase in the money (ITM) refers to an option that possesses intrinsic value. An option that's in the money is an option that presents a profit opportunity due to the relationship between the strike price and the prevailing market price of the underlying asset.Due to the expenses (such as commissions) involved with options, an option that is ITM does not necessarily mean a trader will make aÂ profit by exercising it.Options can also be at the money (ATM) and out of the money (OTM).
