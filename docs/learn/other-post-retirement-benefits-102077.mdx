As medical costs continued to rise, companies gradually added non-pension benefits such as health insurance to attract and retain talented employees. In the 1980s, the U.S. government began requiring companies to disclose OPEB-related information in their financial statements to increase transparency and accountability.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Non-Pension Benefits:</strong> OPEB includes various non-pension benefits such as health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, and life insurance.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Commitment:</strong> Companies make a long-term commitment to employees, with benefits typically covering the entire retirement period.</li><li><strong>Financial Burden:</strong> Companies need to estimate and allocate funds in advance to ensure they can fulfill these benefit commitments.</li><li><strong>Benefit Management:</strong> Specialized management and financial arrangements are required to meet the needs of retired employees.</li></ol><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Case 1: Retiree Health Insurance</strong>: A large manufacturing company provides comprehensive health insurance for its retired employees, covering hospitalization, outpatient, and prescription costs after retirement.
