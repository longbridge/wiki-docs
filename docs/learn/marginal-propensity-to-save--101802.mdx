In Keynesian economics theory, marginal propensity to save (MPS) refers to the proportion of an aggregate raise in income that a consumer saves rather than spends on the consumption of goods and services. Put differently, MPS is the proportion of each added dollar of income that is saved rather than spent. MPS is a component of Keynesian macroeconomics theory and is calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income.MPS is depicted by a savings line: a sloped line created by plotting change in savings on the vertical y-axis and change in income on the horizontal x-axis.
