The term peer group refers to a group of individuals or companies that share similar characteristics with one another. These characteristics may be age, education, ethnic background, size, industry, or sector. Peer groups are known for their influential nature as they are able to shape the decisions of members of the group. As such, peer groups often contain hierarchies, with clear leaders who sit at the top. Peer groups are often used in analysis in a number of academic and professional fields.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>A peer group refers to a group of individuals or companies that share similar characteristics. These characteristics may include age, educational background, racial background, size, industry, or sector. Peer groups are known for their influential nature, as they can affect the decisions of their members. Therefore, peer groups often have a hierarchical structure with clear leaders at the top. Peer groups are frequently used in analyses across many academic and professional fields.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of peer groups originated from sociological and psychological studies, dating back to the early 20th century. As social sciences developed, researchers found that individuals' behaviors and decisions are often influenced by the groups they belong to. By the mid-20th century, the concept of peer groups was gradually introduced into business and finance to analyze company and market behaviors.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Peer groups can be classified based on different characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Age Groups:</strong> For example, Millennials and Baby Boomers.</li><li><strong>Industry Groups:</strong> For example, the tech industry and manufacturing.</li><li><strong>Size Groups:</strong> For example, large enterprises and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</li></ul><p>Each category of peer group has its unique characteristics and influence.
