Levered free cash flow (LFCF) is the amount of money a company has left remaining after paying all of its financial obligations. LFCF is the amount of cash a company has after paying debts, while unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) is cash before debt payments are made. Levered free cash flow is important because it is the amount of cash that a company can use to pay dividends and make investments in the business.
