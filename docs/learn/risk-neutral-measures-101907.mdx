A risk neutral measure is a probability measure used in mathematical finance to aid in pricing derivatives and other financial assets. Risk neutral measures give investors a mathematical interpretation of the overall market’s risk averseness to a particular asset, which must be taken into account in order to estimate the correct price for that asset.A risk neutral measure is also known as an equilibrium measure or equivalent martingale measure.
