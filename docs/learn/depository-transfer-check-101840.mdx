A depository transfer check (DTC) is used by a designated collection bank to deposit the daily receipts of a corporation from multiple locations. Depository transfer checks are a way to ensure better cash management for companies, whichÂ collect cash at multiple locations.Data is transferred by a third-party information service from each location, from which DTCs are created for each deposit location. This information is then entered into the check-processing system at the destination bank for deposit.
