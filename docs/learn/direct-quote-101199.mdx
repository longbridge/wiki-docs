A direct quote is a foreign exchange rate quoted in fixed units of foreign currency in variable amounts of the domestic currency. In other words, a direct currency quote asks what amount of domestic currency is needed to buy one unit of the foreign currency—most commonly the U.S. dollar (USD) in forex markets. In a direct quote, the foreign currency is the base currency, while the domestic currency is the counter currency or quote currency.This can be contrasted with an indirect quote, in which the price of the domestic currency is expressed in terms of a foreign currency, or what is the amount of domestic currency received when one unit of the foreign currency is sold. Note that a quote involving two foreign currencies (or one not involving USD) is called a cross currency quote.
