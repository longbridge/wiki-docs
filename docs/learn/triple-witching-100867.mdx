Triple witching is the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options contracts all on the same trading day. This happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. A common expiration date for the three types of equities derivatives can cause increased trading volume and unusual price action in the underlying assets.
