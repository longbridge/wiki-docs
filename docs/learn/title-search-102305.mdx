The term title search refers to the examination of public records to determine and confirm a property's legal ownership. Title searches are conducted through many sources, including deeds, tax liens, land records, court judgments, among others. Normally conducted by title companies, searches can be ordered by individuals and businesses at any time to find out what, if any, claims or liens are on the property in question. A clean title is required for any real estate transaction to be completed. Transactions cannot be completed if a title search determines there is a lien on the property.
