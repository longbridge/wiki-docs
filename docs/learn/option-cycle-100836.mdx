Option cycle refers to the expiration dates that apply to the different classes of options. A newly listed option is assigned a cycle randomly to broadly distribute options across varying time frames. It is also known as an expiration cycle.With a few exceptions that have contracts every month, most equity options are set up on one of three cycles. Knowing which cycle an option is on tells you when the option can expire if not exercised.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An options cycle refers to the expiration dates applicable to different categories of options. Newly listed options are randomly assigned a cycle to distribute options across different time frames. It is also known as the expiration cycle. With a few exceptions where contracts are available every month, most stock options are set on one of three cycles. Knowing which cycle an option is on can tell you when the option will expire if not exercised.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the options cycle originated in the early development of the options market. To standardize the expiration dates of options, exchanges introduced a cyclical expiration mechanism. After the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was established in 1973, options trading became more regulated, and the concept of the options cycle was established.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The options cycle is mainly divided into three categories: January-April-July-October cycle, February-May-August-November cycle, and March-June-September-December cycle. The characteristics of each cycle are as follows:<ul><li><strong>January-April-July-October cycle:</strong> Applicable to options expiring in January, April, July, and October.</li><li><strong>February-May-August-November cycle:</strong> Applicable to options expiring in February, May, August, and November.</li><li><strong>March-June-September-December cycle:</strong> Applicable to options expiring in March, June, September, and December.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose you purchase an option expiring in January. This option belongs to the January-April-July-October cycle. You can expect corresponding options to expire in April, July, and October.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> If you hold an option expiring in May, it belongs to the February-May-August-November cycle. You can expect corresponding options to expire in February, August, and November.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How do I know which cycle an option belongs to?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> You can determine the cycle by checking the option's expiration month.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> How does the options cycle affect investment strategy?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Understanding the options cycle can help you better plan your investment strategy and avoid exercising options at inappropriate times.</li></ul></p>`} id={100836} />
