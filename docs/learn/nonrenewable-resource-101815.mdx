<p>The term nonrenewable&nbsp;resource&nbsp;refers to a natural substance that is not replenished with the speed at which it is consumed. As such, a nonrenewable resource is a finite resource. Humans constantly draw on the reserves of these substances while the formation of new supplies takes eons.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of nonrenewable resources include fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal. The opposite of a nonrenewable resource is a renewable resource. The supplies of these resources replenish naturally or can be sustained.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Non-renewable resources are natural substances whose consumption rate cannot match their replenishment rate. Therefore, non-renewable resources are finite. Humans continuously deplete these reserves, and the formation of new resources takes a long time.</p><p>Examples of non-renewable resources include fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal. The corresponding concept to non-renewable resources is renewable resources, which can be naturally replenished or continuously available.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of non-renewable resources stems from the recognition of the finiteness of natural resources. With the advancement of the Industrial Revolution, human dependence on fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources gradually increased. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists and economists began to realize the limitations of these resources and proposed the idea of sustainable development.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Non-renewable resources are mainly divided into two categories: fossil fuels and mineral resources. Fossil fuels include oil, natural gas, and coal, which are formed from ancient biological remains under geological processes. Mineral resources include metallic ores (such as iron, copper, aluminum) and non-metallic ores (such as limestone, phosphate). The common characteristics of these resources are long formation time, limited reserves, and non-renewability.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. Oil: Oil is the lifeblood of modern industry, widely used in transportation, power generation, and chemical production. The Middle East is one of the regions with the richest oil reserves globally. As oil resources are continuously extracted, reserves are gradually decreasing, and price fluctuations are becoming more frequent. 2. Coal: Coal was one of the earliest fossil fuels to be used on a large scale, mainly for power generation and steel production. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal. Although coal resources are abundant, their extraction and use have caused severe environmental pollution, prompting countries to gradually shift to cleaner energy sources.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why do non-renewable resources deplete? Because their formation takes millions of years, and the rate of human consumption far exceeds the natural replenishment rate. 2. How to cope with the depletion of non-renewable resources? It can be addressed by improving energy efficiency, developing alternative energy sources (such as solar and wind energy), and enhancing resource recycling.</p>`} id={101815} />
