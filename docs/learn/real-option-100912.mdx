A real option is an economically valuable right to make or else abandon some choice that is available to the managers of a company, often concerning business projects or investment opportunities. It is referred to as “real” because it typically references projects involving a tangible asset (such as machinery, land, and buildings, as well as inventory), instead of a financial instrument.Real options differ thus from financial options contracts since they involve real (i.e. physical) "underlying" assets and are not exchangeable as securities.
