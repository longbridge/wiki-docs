The European Currency Unit (ECU) was the official monetary unit of the European Monetary System (EMS) before it was replaced by the euro.

<AIContent content={`<h2>European Currency Unit (ECU)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The European Currency Unit (ECU) was the official currency unit of the European Monetary System (EMS) before it was replaced by the euro. The value of the ECU was used to determine exchange rates and reserves among EMS member countries, but it was always an accounting unit rather than a real currency.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The ECU was introduced on March 13, 1979. It was established to promote European economic integration and stabilize exchange rates among member countries.
