Trading risk reserve refers to the reserves set aside by a company to hedge against the risks brought by financial instrument trading. This reserve can be used to offset trading losses and protect the company from potential future losses. The trading risk reserve is usually provisioned by financial institutions based on their internal risk management system and regulatory requirements.
