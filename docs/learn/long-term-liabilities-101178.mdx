Long-term liabilities are a company's financial obligations that are due more than one year in the future. The current portion of long-term debt is listed separately on the balance sheet to provide a more accurate view of a company's current liquidity and the companyâ€™s ability to pay current liabilities as they become due. Long-term liabilities are also called long-term debt or noncurrent liabilities.
