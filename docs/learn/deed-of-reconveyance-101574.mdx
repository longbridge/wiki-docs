A deed of reconveyance is a document that transfers the title of a property from a mortgage lender to the borrower once the loan has been paid.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A satisfaction of mortgage is a document issued after a loan has been fully repaid, transferring the ownership of real estate from the mortgage lender to the borrower. This document is typically issued by the lending institution, certifying that the borrower has fully repaid the loan and that the property is no longer subject to the mortgage lien.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of a satisfaction of mortgage originated with the development of the modern financial system, particularly with the widespread use of real estate mortgages. As loan and mortgage systems became more structured, the satisfaction of mortgage became an important document to ensure the rights of borrowers. Its history can be traced back to the early 20th century when banks and financial institutions began systematically managing mortgages and related documents.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> There are mainly two types of satisfaction of mortgage: full satisfaction of mortgage, indicating that the borrower has fully repaid the loan, and partial satisfaction of mortgage, indicating that the borrower has repaid part of the loan but still has an outstanding balance. The full satisfaction of mortgage releases all mortgage liens, while the partial satisfaction of mortgage only releases part of the liens. They are used in different scenarios: the former is applicable when the loan is fully repaid, and the latter is used for partial or installment repayments.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: Mr. Zhang took out a loan from a bank to purchase a house. After 20 years of mortgage payments, Mr. Zhang finally repaid the entire loan. The bank issued a full satisfaction of mortgage, certifying that Mr. Zhang had fully repaid the loan and that the house's ownership was entirely his. Case 2: Ms. Li took out a loan from a bank to purchase a house but chose to repay part of the loan early. The bank issued a partial satisfaction of mortgage, certifying that Ms. Li had repaid part of the loan but still had an outstanding balance, meaning the house's ownership was still partially subject to the mortgage lien.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Q: How long does it take to receive a satisfaction of mortgage? A: Typically, the lending institution will issue the satisfaction of mortgage within a few weeks after the borrower has fully repaid the loan. 2. Q: What should I do if I lose the satisfaction of mortgage? A: You can contact the lending institution to request a replacement, but you may need to provide relevant proof. 3. Q: Does the satisfaction of mortgage need to be notarized? A: This depends on local laws and the requirements of the lending institution. In some places, notarization may be required to ensure the document's legal validity.</p>`} id={101574} />
