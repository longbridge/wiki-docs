Owner financing is a transaction in which a property's seller finances the purchase directly with the person or entity buying it, either in whole or in part. This type of arrangement can be advantageous for both sellers and buyers because it eliminates the costs of a bank intermediary. Owner financing can create much greater risk and responsibilities for the owner, however.
