The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization that promotes global economic growth and financial stability, encourages international trade, and reduces poverty.Quotas of member countries are a key determinant of the voting power in IMF decisions. Votes comprise one vote per 100,000 special drawing rights (SDR) of quota plus basic votes. SDRs are an international type of monetary reserve currency created by the IMF as a supplement to the existing money reserves of member countries.
