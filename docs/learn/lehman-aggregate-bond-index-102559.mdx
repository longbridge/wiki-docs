The Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index or "the Agg" is a broad-based fixed-income index used by bond traders and the managers of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a benchmark to measure their relative performance.The Agg is to the bond market what the Wilshire 5000 Total Stock Index is to the equity market.The index has been known as the Bloomberg Agg only since August 2021. It was for many years the Barclays Agg. Bloomberg purchased Barclays fixed-income indexes in 2016 and, for the following five years, labeled them as Bloomberg Barclays indices. All now carry only the Bloomberg name.
