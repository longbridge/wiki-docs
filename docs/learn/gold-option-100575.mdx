A gold option is an options contract that utilizes either physical gold or gold futures as its underlying asset.A gold call option would give the holder the right,Â but not the obligation, to buy bullion at a future date at a set price, while a put option would grant the holder the right to sell it at a predetermined price level. The option agreement terms will list details such as the delivery date, quantity, and strike price, which are all predetermined.
