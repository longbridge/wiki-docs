EPS growth refers to the growth rate of earnings per share (EPS) of a company over a period of time. EPS refers to the net income available to common shareholders per share and is an important indicator of a company's profitability. The EPS growth rate can reflect the improvement of a company's profitability, and a higher EPS growth rate is usually considered as a good performance of a company's profitability.
