A long-term capital gain or loss is the gain or loss stemming from the sale of a qualifying investment that has been owned for longer than 12 months at the time of sale.Â This may be contrasted with short-term gains or losses on investments that are disposed of in less than 12 months. Long-term capital gains are often given more favorable tax treatment than short-term gains.
