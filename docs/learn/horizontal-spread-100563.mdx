<p><span style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(0,0,0,0.05)",color:"rgb(36,41,47)"}}>A Horizontal Spread, also known as a Time Spread or Calendar Spread, is an options trading strategy. This strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling options contracts with the same strike price but different expiration dates. Typically, a trader will buy a long-term option and sell a short-term option. The goal of a horizontal spread is to profit from the difference in time value, especially when the underlying asset's price is not expected to move significantly. By employing this strategy, traders can benefit from the different rates of time decay (the reduction in the value of an option as it approaches its expiration date). Horizontal spreads are suitable for investors who have an expectation of market volatility but are uncertain about the specific direction of the price movement.</span></p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br/>Horizontal Spread, also known as Time Spread or Calendar Spread, is an options trading strategy. This strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling options contracts with the same strike price but different expiration dates. Typically, traders buy long-term options and sell short-term options. The goal of a horizontal spread is to profit from the difference in time value, especially when the underlying asset's price is not expected to fluctuate significantly. Through this strategy, traders can benefit from the different rates of time decay (i.e., the reduction in the value of options over time). Horizontal spreads are suitable for investors who have some expectations about market volatility but are uncertain about the specific direction.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong><br/>The horizontal spread strategy originated in the early development of the options market. As options trading became more popular and complex, traders began to explore different strategies to manage risk and enhance returns. The time spread strategy was gradually discovered and applied because it could provide stable returns in low-volatility market conditions.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong><br/>Horizontal spreads are mainly divided into two categories: Bullish Horizontal Spread and Bearish Horizontal Spread.<br/>1. Bullish Horizontal Spread: Buying long-term call options and selling short-term call options. Suitable for situations where the underlying asset price is expected to rise slightly or remain stable.<br/>2. Bearish Horizontal Spread: Buying long-term put options and selling short-term put options. Suitable for situations where the underlying asset price is expected to fall slightly or remain stable.<br/>Characteristics:<br/>- Time Value Difference: Profiting from the time value difference of options with different expiration dates.<br/>- Limited Risk: The maximum loss is the initial investment cost.<br/>- Limited Profit: The maximum profit is realized when the underlying asset price is close to the strike price.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>Case 1: Suppose the current price of the underlying asset is $100, and the investor expects the price to remain stable over the next month. The investor can buy a call option expiring in three months (strike price $100, cost $5) and simultaneously sell a call option expiring in one month (strike price $100, income $3). If the underlying asset price remains close to $100 after one month, the short-term option will expire worthless, allowing the investor to keep the income from the sold option while holding the long-term option.<br/>Case 2: Suppose the current price of the underlying asset is $50, and the investor expects the price to remain stable over the next two months. The investor can buy a put option expiring in six months (strike price $50, cost $4) and simultaneously sell a put option expiring in two months (strike price $50, income $2). If the underlying asset price remains close to $50 after two months, the short-term option will expire worthless, allowing the investor to keep the income from the sold option while holding the long-term option.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. What is the maximum risk of a horizontal spread?<br/>The maximum risk is the initial investment cost, which is the cost of buying the long-term option minus the income from selling the short-term option.<br/>2. When is it suitable to use a horizontal spread strategy?<br/>It is suitable to use a horizontal spread strategy when the underlying asset price is not expected to fluctuate significantly, and market volatility is low.</p>`} id={100563} />
