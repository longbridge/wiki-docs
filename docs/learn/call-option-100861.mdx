Call options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right—but not the obligation—to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific period. A call seller must sell the asset if the buyer exercises the call.A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price. The seller profits from the premium if the price drops below the strike price at expiration because the buyer will typically not execute the option.A call option may be contrasted with a put option, which gives the holder the right to sell (force the buyer to purchase) the asset at a specified price on or before expiration.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A call option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase stocks, bonds, commodities, or other assets or instruments at a specified price within a specified period. If the buyer exercises the call option, the seller must sell the asset. When the price of the underlying asset rises, the call option buyer profits. If the price falls below the strike price at expiration, the call option seller profits from the option premium, as the buyer typically will not exercise the option. Call options can be contrasted with put options, which give the holder the right to sell (forcing the buyer to purchase) the asset at a specified price before or at expiration.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of call options can be traced back to ancient Greece, but the modern options market began with the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973. The CBOE's creation marked the beginning of standardized option contracts and centralized trading, making options trading more transparent and regulated.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Call options can be classified based on different criteria:<ul><li><strong>By expiration time:</strong> American options and European options. American options can be exercised at any time before the expiration date, while European options can only be exercised on the expiration date.</li><li><strong>By underlying asset:</strong> Stock options, bond options, commodity options, etc. Options on different underlying assets have different risk and return characteristics.</li></ul>The main characteristics of call options include:<ul><li>The buyer has the right but not the obligation to purchase.</li><li>The seller must sell the underlying asset if the buyer exercises the option.</li><li>The option premium is the price paid by the buyer to obtain the option.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose Investor A buys a call option on Apple Inc. stock with a strike price of $150 and an expiration date three months later.
