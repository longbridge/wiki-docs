Unsecured debt refers to loans that are not backed by collateral. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender may not be able to recover their investment because the borrower is not required to pledge any specific assets as security for the loan.Because unsecured loans are considered riskier for the lender, they generally carry higher interest rates than collateralized loans.
