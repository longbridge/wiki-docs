An unamortized bond premium refers to the difference between a bond's face value and its sale price. If a bond is sold at a discount, for instance, at 90 cents on the dollar, the issuer must still repay the full 100 cents of face value at par. Since this interest amount has not yet been paid to bondholders, it is a liability for the issuer.
