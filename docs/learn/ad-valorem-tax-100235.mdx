<p>Ad Valorem Tax is a type of tax that is levied based on the value of a good or service. The tax rate is usually expressed as a percentage and directly depends on the market value of the item or service. Specifically, ad valorem tax can be applied in various contexts, including import and export goods, property taxes, and sales taxes. Since the tax amount is proportional to the value of the good or service, the revenue from ad valorem tax fluctuates with changes in the price of the good or service.</p>
