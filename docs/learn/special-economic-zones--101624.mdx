A special economic zone (SEZ) is an area in a country that is designed to generate positive economic growth. An SEZ is normally subject to different and more favorable economic regulations compared to other regions in the same country, including tax incentives and the opportunity to pay lower tariffs. SEZ economic regulations tend to be conducive to—and attract—foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI refers to any investment made by a firm or individual in one country into business interests located in another country.
