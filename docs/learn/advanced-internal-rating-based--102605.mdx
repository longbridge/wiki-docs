An advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) approach to credit risk measurement is a method that requests that all risk components be calculated internally within a financial institution. Advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) can help an institution reduce its capital requirements and credit risk.In addition to the basic internal rating-based (IRB) approach estimations, the advanced approach assesses the risk of default using loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), and the probability of default (PD). These three elements help determine the risk-weighted asset (RWA) that is calculated on a percentage basis for the total required capital."
