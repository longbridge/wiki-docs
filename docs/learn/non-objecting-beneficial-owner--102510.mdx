A non-objecting beneficial owner (NOBO) is a beneficial owner of a company who gives permission to a financial intermediary to release their name and address to the companies or issuers in which they have bought securities. This allows companies to contact the beneficial owner directly with various communication related to the business. However, the SEC still maintains that beneficial owners should be contacted via an intermediary, such as a broker, for proxy materials.
