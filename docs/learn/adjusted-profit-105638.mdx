Adjusted profit refers to the net profit of a company after deducting non-recurring gains and losses and other special items, reflecting the company's operating performance and true profitability. Non-recurring gains and losses and other special items include but are not limited to: government subsidies, non-recurring asset impairment losses, restructuring costs, etc. Adjusted profit is one of the important indicators for investors to judge the financial condition and profitability of a company.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Adjusted Profit</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Adjusted profit refers to the net profit of a company after excluding non-recurring gains and losses and other special items. It reflects the company's operating performance and true profitability. Non-recurring gains and losses and other special items include, but are not limited to, government subsidies, non-recurring asset impairment losses, restructuring costs, etc. Adjusted profit is an important indicator for investors to assess a company's financial condition and profitability.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of adjusted profit originated in the late 20th century. As the complexity of corporate financial reporting increased, investors and analysts needed a more accurate indicator to reflect the core operating conditions of a company. Especially in the context of economic fluctuations and frequent corporate restructurings, traditional net profit indicators might be affected by one-time items, thus failing to truly reflect the company's profitability.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Adjusted profit mainly includes the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Excluding non-recurring gains and losses:</strong> such as government subsidies, fines, donations, etc.</li><li><strong>Excluding special items:</strong> such as asset impairment losses, restructuring costs, litigation costs, etc.</li></ul><p>These adjustments allow adjusted profit to more accurately reflect the company's daily operating conditions, avoiding distortions caused by one-time items.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company reported a net profit of 50 million yuan in 2023, but this included a 20 million yuan government subsidy and a 10 million yuan asset impairment loss. The adjusted profit is 50 million yuan - 20 million yuan + 10 million yuan = 40 million yuan, which better reflects the company's actual operating conditions.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company underwent a large-scale restructuring in 2023, reporting a net profit of 30 million yuan, but restructuring costs amounted to 15 million yuan. The adjusted profit is 30 million yuan + 15 million yuan = 45 million yuan, showing the company's profitability after restructuring.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: Why is adjusted profit more important than net profit?</strong><br/>A1: Adjusted profit excludes non-recurring gains and losses and special items, better reflecting the company's core operating conditions and true profitability.</p><p><strong>Q2: Is adjusted profit completely reliable?</strong><br/>A2: While adjusted profit provides a clearer view of profitability, it should still be analyzed in conjunction with other financial indicators and the company's background.</p>`} id={105638} />
