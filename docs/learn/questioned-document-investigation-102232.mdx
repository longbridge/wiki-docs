A questioned document investigation is an in-depth look into a document that is being questioned in the case of fraud, forgery, etc. The investigation is usually initiated in the event that large sums of money, heirlooms, or other assets are being called into question by a third party. A questioned document investigation may also be called upon to discover altered documents, fabricated checks, anonymous letters, disputed wills, and many other disputed documents. A forensic analysis of the questioned document will typically involve a comprehensive analysis of the paper, ink, indentations, and tools used to produce the document.
