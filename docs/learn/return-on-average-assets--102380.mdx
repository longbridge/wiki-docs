Return on average assets (ROAA) is an indicator used to assess the profitability of a firm's assets, and it is most often used by banks and other financial institutions as a means to gauge financial performance. Sometimes, ROAA is used interchangeably with return on assets (ROA) although the latter often uses current assets instead of average assets.
