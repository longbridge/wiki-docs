<p>The Situational Leadership Model or Theory, also known as the Hersey-Blanchard Model, suggests that no single leadership style is better than another. Instead of focusing on workplace factors, the model suggests that leaders should adjust their techniques to those they lead and their abilities.</p><p>Under the model, successful leadership is both task-relevant and relationship-relevant. It is an adaptive, flexible style in which leaders are encouraged to consider their followers—individuals or a team—then consider the factors that impact the work environment before choosing how they will lead. This gives them a better chance of meeting their goals.</p>

The project manager adopts a Participating leadership style, discussing project details with team members to spark their interest and involvement.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How can one assess the competence and commitment of subordinates?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> By observing their work performance, communicating with them, and understanding their background and experience, one can assess their competence and commitment.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is it possible to use multiple leadership styles simultaneously?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.
