Joint supply is an economic term referring to a product or process that can yield two or more outputs. Common examples occur within the livestock industry: cows can be utilized for milk, beef, and hide. Sheep can be utilized for meat, milk products,Â wool, and sheepskin. If the supply of cows increases, so will the joint supply of dairy and beef products.
