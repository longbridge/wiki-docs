<p>Impairment reserve is a provision made by a company when preparing financial statements to anticipate potential impairment risks. The purpose of impairment reserve is to ensure that the financial statements of a company can truly reflect the value of its assets and avoid the overestimation of asset value, which may result in operational risks for the company. When preparing financial statements, a certain amount of impairment reserve will be determined based on the estimated impairment risk.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Asset impairment provision is a reserve made by a company in its financial statements to address potential asset impairment risks. The purpose is to ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the value of the company's assets, preventing overestimation of asset value and subsequent operational risks. Companies determine the amount of asset impairment provision based on estimated asset impairment risks when preparing financial statements.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of asset impairment provision originated in the late 20th century. With the increasing complexity of the global economic environment and rising operational risks, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and national accounting standard-setting bodies gradually introduced requirements for asset impairment provisions. The aim was to enhance the transparency and reliability of financial statements, ensuring that investors and other stakeholders could accurately assess a company's financial condition.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Asset impairment provisions can be categorized as follows:<ul><li><strong>Fixed Asset Impairment Provision:</strong> For fixed assets such as buildings and equipment, when the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment provision is required.</li><li><strong>Intangible Asset Impairment Provision:</strong> For intangible assets such as patents and trademarks, when the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment provision is required.</li><li><strong>Inventory Impairment Provision:</strong> For inventories such as raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods, when the net realizable value is less than the cost, an impairment provision is required.</li><li><strong>Accounts Receivable Impairment Provision:</strong> For accounts receivable, when a significant portion is expected to be uncollectible, an impairment provision is required.</li></ul>Common characteristics of these impairment provisions include:<ul><li>Preventive: Reserving funds in advance to address potential future asset impairment risks.</li><li>Timeliness: Adjusting the amount of impairment provision promptly based on the actual condition of assets and changes in the market environment.</li><li>Accuracy: Ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect the value of the company's assets.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A manufacturing company, during the preparation of its annual financial statements, discovers that a large piece of production equipment has significantly decreased in market value due to technological advancements. After evaluation, the recoverable amount of the equipment is found to be less than its book value, prompting the company to make a fixed asset impairment provision to reflect the actual value of the equipment.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A tech company owns a patent, but due to changes in market demand, the expected revenue from the patent has significantly decreased. After evaluation, the company determines that the recoverable amount of the patent is less than its book value, leading to an intangible asset impairment provision.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Q:</strong> Does asset impairment provision affect a company's profit?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, making an asset impairment provision directly reduces a company's profit, as the amount is recorded as an expense in the current period's profit and loss.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong> Can a company arbitrarily adjust the amount of asset impairment provision?<br/><strong>A:</strong> No, companies must determine the amount of impairment provision based on actual conditions and reasonable estimates, following relevant accounting standards.</li></ul></p>`} id={299} />
