A share repurchase is a transaction whereby a company buys back its own shares from the marketplace. A company might buy back its shares because management considers them undervalued. The company buys shares directly from the market or offers its shareholders the option of tendering their shares directly to the company at a fixed price.Repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which is something that investors often feel will drive up share prices. This assumes demand for the shares will not be diminished by the action.
