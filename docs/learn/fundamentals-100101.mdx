Fundamentals include the basic qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to the financial or economic well-being of a company, security,Â or currency, and their subsequent financial valuation. Where qualitative information includes elements that cannot be directly measured, such as management experience, quantitative analysis (QA) uses mathematics and statistics to understand the asset and predict its movements.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Fundamentals</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Fundamentals refer to the basic qualitative and quantitative information that affects the financial or economic condition of a company, security, or currency, and its subsequent financial valuation. Qualitative information includes elements that cannot be directly measured, such as management experience, while quantitative analysis uses mathematics and statistics to understand assets and predict their movements.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of fundamental analysis originated in the early 20th century. As financial markets developed, investors realized that relying solely on price fluctuations for investment decisions was risky. In 1928, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd systematically introduced the method of fundamental analysis in their book 'Security Analysis,' laying the foundation for modern fundamental analysis.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Fundamental analysis is mainly divided into two categories: qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis focuses on factors that are difficult to quantify, such as the experience of the management team, market competitiveness, and brand value. Quantitative analysis evaluates a company's financial health and future profitability through financial statements and ratio analysis. The advantage of qualitative analysis is that it can capture potential values that are difficult to quantify, but its drawback is its subjectivity. Quantitative analysis is objective and quantifiable but may overlook some non-financial factors.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: An investor analyzing a tech company finds through quantitative analysis that the company's revenue and profits have been growing steadily over the past three years, indicating good financial health. Additionally, qualitative analysis reveals that the management team is experienced and the company has a good market reputation, leading the investor to decide to invest in the company.</p><p>Case 2: Another investor analyzing a traditional manufacturing company finds that its financial statements show a high debt ratio and tight cash flow. Despite the company's brand influence in the industry, frequent changes in management and intense market competition lead the investor to decide not to invest in the company.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Can fundamental analysis guarantee investment success?<br/>Answer: Fundamental analysis cannot guarantee investment success but can help investors better understand and evaluate the intrinsic value of investment targets, leading to more informed decisions.</p><p>2. What is the difference between fundamental analysis and technical analysis?<br/>Answer: Fundamental analysis focuses on the intrinsic value and long-term growth potential of a company, while technical analysis focuses on historical price and volume data, using charts and indicators to predict price trends.</p>`} id={100101} />
