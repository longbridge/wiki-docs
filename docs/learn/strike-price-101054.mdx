Options contracts are derivatives that give the holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell some underlying security at some point in the future at a pre-specified price. This price is known as the option's strike price (or exercise price). For call options, the strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder; for put options, the strike price is the price at which the security can be sold.An option's value is informed by the difference between the fixed strike price and the market price of the underlying security, known as the option's "moneyness."For call options, strikes lower than the market price are said to be in-the-money (ITM), since you can exercise the option to buy the stock for less than the market and immediately sell it at the higher market price. Likewise, in-the-money puts are those with strikes higher than the market price, giving the holder the right to sell the option above the current market price. This feature grants ITM options intrinsic value.Calls with strikes that are higher than the market, or puts with strikes lower than the market, are instead out-of-the-money (OTM), and only have extrinsic value (also known as time value).
