The term value change refers to a daily adjustment made to the price of a company's stock. This change reflects the number of outstanding shares issued and currently held by investors. This figure is updated on a daily basis. Since the number of shares held by investors changes daily, this number can be updated every day to reflect the changes. It allows a group of stocks to be equally weighted and more easily evaluated by investors, analysts, and other financial professionals.
