<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition of Share Capital</h2><p>Share capital refers to the total amount of capital raised by a company through various equity financing methods. It forms the foundation of the company's capital structure and represents the shareholders' investment in the company.

Over time, the concept of share capital evolved and became widely used globally.</p><h2>Classification and Characteristics of Share Capital</h2><p>Share capital can be divided into two main categories: common shares and preferred shares:</p><ul><li><strong>Common Shares:</strong> Common shares are the most common form of share capital. Holders have the right to share in the company's residual profits and have voting rights, but their claims are subordinate to preferred shareholders in the event of liquidation.</li><li><strong>Preferred Shares:</strong> Preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders in profit distribution and liquidation but usually do not have voting rights. The dividends on preferred shares are typically fixed.</li></ul><h2>Comparison with Similar Concepts</h2><p>Share capital and debt capital are the two main ways a company can raise funds. Share capital represents shareholders' investment, while debt capital is the funds a company obtains through borrowing. Share capital does not need to be repaid, but shareholders have the right to share in the company's profits; debt capital must be repaid with interest.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A tech company raised 100 million yuan in share capital by issuing 10 million common shares at 10 yuan per share through an initial public offering (IPO).
