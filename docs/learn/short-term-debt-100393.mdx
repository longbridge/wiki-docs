<p>Short-term debt refers to any debt that is due to be paid off within one year or within a business's operating cycle, whichever is longer. This type of debt is typically used to cover immediate financial needs, such as purchasing inventory, covering operating expenses, or addressing short-term cash flow issues.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Short-term debt refers to the debt that a business or individual needs to repay within one year or one operating cycle.
