<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Accrued interest refers to the interest expenses that a company should pay to the lender. Borrowing is a way for companies to obtain funds, and the borrower needs to pay a certain amount of interest to the lender for the funds obtained. This interest expense is the accrued interest.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of accrued interest emerged with the advent of lending activities. Lending activities existed as early as ancient times, where borrowers had to pay a certain amount of interest as the cost of using the funds. With the development of financial markets, the forms and methods of calculating interest payments have gradually become standardized.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Accrued interest can be divided into short-term accrued interest and long-term accrued interest. Short-term accrued interest usually refers to interest that needs to be paid within one year, while long-term accrued interest refers to interest payments that exceed one year. Short-term accrued interest typically has a higher interest rate but a shorter payment cycle; long-term accrued interest has a relatively lower interest rate but a longer payment cycle.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A company borrows 1 million yuan from a bank at an annual interest rate of 5% for a term of one year. The company needs to pay 1 million yuan * 5% = 50,000 yuan in interest annually, which is the accrued interest. Case 2: A company issues corporate bonds with a face value of 5 million yuan at an annual interest rate of 4% for a term of 5 years. The company needs to pay 5 million yuan * 4% = 200,000 yuan in interest annually, which is the accrued interest.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. What is the difference between accrued interest and accrued interest payable? Accrued interest refers to interest that has already accrued but has not yet been paid, while accrued interest payable refers to interest that has already accrued and is due for payment. 2. How is accrued interest calculated? The formula for calculating accrued interest is: Accrued Interest = Loan Amount * Interest Rate * Loan Term.</p>`} id={106} />
