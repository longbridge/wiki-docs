The accounting equation states that a company's total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and its shareholders' equity.This straightforward relationship between assets, liabilities, and equity is considered to be the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. The accounting equation ensures that the balance sheet remains balanced. That is, each entry made on the debit side has a corresponding entry (or coverage) on the credit side.The accounting equation is also called the basic accounting equation or the balance sheet equation.
