Over and short—often called "cash over short"—is an accounting term that signals a discrepancy between a company's reported figures (from its sales records or receipts) and its audited figures. The term also is the name of an account in a company's general ledger—the cash-over-short account.This term pertains primarily to cash-intensive businesses in the retail and banking sectors, as well as those that need to handle pettycash. If a cashier or bank teller errs by giving too much or too little change, for example, then the business will have a "cash short" or "cash over" position at the end of the day.
