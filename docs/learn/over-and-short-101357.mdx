<p>"Over and Short" refers to the discrepancies between the actual recorded amounts and the expected or should-be recorded amounts in accounting or financial management. These discrepancies can arise from various causes, including recording errors, calculation mistakes, theft or fraud, inventory management issues, or other operational errors. Over and short discrepancies can occur in areas such as cash management, inventory management, and bank reconciliation. When such discrepancies are identified, businesses typically need to investigate the causes and take appropriate corrective actions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of financial records. Frequent occurrences of over and short discrepancies may indicate flaws in the internal control system of the business, necessitating audits and improvements.</p>
