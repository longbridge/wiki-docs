A GDP gap is the difference between the actual gross domestic product (GDP) and the potential GDP of an economy as represented by the long-term trend. A negative GDP gap represents the forfeited output of a country's economy resulting from the failure to create sufficient jobs for all those willing to work. A large positive GDP gap, on the other hand, generally signifies that an economy is overheated and at risk of high inflation.The difference between real GDP and potential GDP is also known as the output gap.
