<AIContent content={`<h2>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an economic indicator that measures the change in the price of a basket of consumer goods and services over time. It reflects the average change in prices paid by consumers and is commonly used as a primary indicator of inflation in a country or region.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of CPI dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when governments began to focus on the cost of living for the working class. The United States first published official CPI data in 1919, and other countries followed suit to monitor inflation.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>CPI can be divided into two main categories: headline CPI and core CPI. Headline CPI includes the price changes of all goods and services, while core CPI excludes the more volatile prices of food and energy. Headline CPI better reflects overall economic inflation, while core CPI is more suitable for long-term trend analysis.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose a country's CPI was 105 in 2023 and rose to 110 in 2024. This indicates an inflation rate of (110-105)/105*100% = 4.76% for that year.</p><p>Case 2: A company paid an average salary of 5000 yuan to its employees in 2023. If the CPI increased by 3% in 2024, the company would need to raise the average salary to 5000*(1+3%) = 5150 yuan to maintain the employees' purchasing power.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why doesn't CPI include housing prices?<br/>Answer: CPI focuses on consumer goods and services used in daily life, and housing prices are highly volatile and not considered daily consumer goods, so they are usually excluded.</p><p>2. Can CPI fully reflect inflation?<br/>Answer: CPI is an important measure of inflation, but due to its calculation method and the selection of the basket of goods, it may not fully reflect the actual cost of living changes for all consumers.</p>`} id={103830} />
