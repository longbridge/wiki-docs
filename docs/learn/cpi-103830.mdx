<p style={{marginLeft:"0px"}}>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an economic indicator that measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services. It is commonly used as one of the primary indicators to gauge the level of inflation within a country or region.</p><p style={{marginLeft:"0px"}}>The calculation of CPI involves tracking the price changes of specific goods and services (such as food, clothing, housing, transportation, and medical services) over a certain period. These goods and services are considered typical purchases made by consumers in their daily lives, thus CPI provides a good reflection of the changes in the cost of living faced by the average consumer.</p><p style={{marginLeft:"0px"}}>The method of calculating CPI includes:</p><ol><li><strong>Selecting a Base Year</strong>: A point in time is chosen as the base year, for which the CPI is set to 100.</li><li><strong>Determining the Basket of Goods</strong>: A set of representative goods and services, based on consumer purchasing habits, is selected to form the "basket."</li><li><strong>Collecting Price Data</strong>: Price data for each item in the basket are collected regularly.</li><li><strong>Calculating the CPI</strong>: The CPI is calculated using the collected price data and the weight of each item in consumer expenditures.</li></ol><p style={{marginLeft:"0px"}}>Changes in the CPI are used to assess changes in consumers' purchasing power, calculate real wage growth rates, adjust social welfare benefits, etc. When the CPI rises, it indicates an increase in the cost of living, signifying inflation; when the CPI falls, it indicates a decrease in the cost of living, signifying deflation.</p><p style={{marginLeft:"0px"}}>Given its direct relevance to the daily lives of consumers, the CPI is one of the key economic indicators closely monitored by governments, central banks, and economists. It plays a significant role in formulating monetary and economic policies.</p>
