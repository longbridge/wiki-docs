A hard stop is more of a concept than an actual order type. A hard stop presumes a price level that, if reached, will decisively trigger an order to sell an underlying security.Hard stops are usually implemented as a stop order on an open position in a market. Such an order is likely set to be good until canceled (GTC) or filled, whichever comes first. When the designated price level is observed, the order may convert into a market order and the next available market price is taken as the trade. The key concept behind the hard stop is that the rule is uncompromising and must be followed regardless of other considerations.
