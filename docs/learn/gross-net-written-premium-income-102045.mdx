Gross net written premium income (GNWPI) is the dollar amount of an insurance company’s premiums that are used to determine what portion of premiums is owed to a reinsurer. Gross net written premium income is the base to which the reinsurance premium rate is applied, taking into account cancellations, refunds, and premiums paid for reinsurance coverage.
