<p>Low/No Documentation Loans are types of loans where borrowers are required to provide minimal or no income, asset, and employment documentation when applying. These loans are typically targeted at self-employed individuals, freelancers, or people with fluctuating incomes who may find it challenging to provide the comprehensive financial documentation required for traditional loans. Low/No Doc Loans have more relaxed approval criteria, requiring borrowers to submit basic personal information and a credit report. These loans were very popular before the 2008 financial crisis, but due to their high-risk nature, many of these loans defaulted. Currently, the issuance of such loans is more stringent, and they come with higher interest rates and fees to compensate lenders for the increased risk.</p>
