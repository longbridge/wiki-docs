Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an ownership stake in a foreign company or project made by an investor, company, or government from another country.Generally, the term is used to describe a business decision to acquire a substantial stake in a foreign business or to buy it outright to expand operations to a new region. The term is usually not used to describe a stock investment in a foreign company alone. FDI is a key element in international economic integration because it creates stable and long-lasting links between economies.
