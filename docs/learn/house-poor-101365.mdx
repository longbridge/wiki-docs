"House poor" is a term used to describe a person who spends a large proportion of his or her total income on homeownership, including mortgage payments, property taxes, maintenance, and utilities. Individuals in this situation are short of cash for discretionary items and tend to have trouble meeting other financial obligations, such as vehicle payments.House poor is sometimes also referred to as house rich, cash poor.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Housing poverty refers to a situation where a household or individual, after purchasing or renting a home, finds that housing-related expenses (such as mortgage payments, rent, property fees, maintenance costs, etc.) take up a large proportion of their income, leaving them with insufficient funds for other living expenses. These households or individuals, despite owning property or living in high-value residences, have their consumption capacity in other areas severely restricted due to high housing costs, making it difficult to cope with daily expenses, emergencies, or savings. Housing poverty is particularly common in areas with high property prices or expensive rents.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of housing poverty first emerged in the mid-20th century. As urbanization accelerated and housing prices continued to rise, more and more families found themselves with insufficient income to maintain basic living standards after paying for housing. This issue is especially pronounced in major cities where housing costs have skyrocketed.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Housing poverty can be divided into the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Homeownership Poverty:</strong> Refers to families who have purchased homes through mortgages and find their quality of life declining due to high monthly mortgage payments.</li><li><strong>Rental Poverty:</strong> Refers to renters whose rent takes up a high proportion of their income, leaving them with insufficient funds for other living expenses.</li><li><strong>Implicit Housing Poverty:</strong> Refers to families whose housing costs are not high, but other living costs are so high that their overall quality of life declines.</li></ul>Common characteristics of these categories include high housing expenses taking up a large proportion of household income, leading to restricted consumption capacity in other areas.</p><p><strong>Case Studies:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Xiao Wang purchased a property in Beijing and has to pay a high monthly mortgage. Despite owning his own home, his remaining income after mortgage payments is only enough to cover basic living expenses, leaving no room for savings or emergencies.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Xiao Li rents an apartment in Shanghai, with rent taking up 50% of his monthly income. After paying rent, he struggles with other expenses and even needs to borrow money to cover daily living costs.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How can I determine if I am in a state of housing poverty?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Generally, if housing expenses (including mortgage payments, rent, property fees, etc.) take up more than 30% of your total household income, you can be considered in a state of housing poverty.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What are the impacts of housing poverty on a family?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Housing poverty can lead to a decline in a family's consumption capacity in other areas, making it difficult to cope with daily expenses, emergencies, or savings, thereby affecting overall quality of life.</li></ul></p>`} id={101365} />
