Fair market value (FMV) is the price a product would sell for on the open market assuming that both buyer and seller are reasonably knowledgeable about the asset, are behaving in their own best interests, are free of undue pressure, and are given a reasonable time period for completing the transaction.Given these conditions, an asset's fair market value should represent an accurate valuation or assessment of its worth.This definition of the term is commonly accepted in tax law, bankruptcy law, and the real estate market.
