A naked call is an options strategy in which an investor writes (sells) call options on the open market without owning the underlying security.This strategy, sometimes referred to as an uncovered call or an unhedged short call, stands in contrast to a covered call strategy, where the investor owns the underlying security on which the call options are written. A naked call can be compared with a naked put.
