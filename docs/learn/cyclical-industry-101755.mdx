A cyclical industry is a type of industry that is sensitive to the business cycle, such that revenues generally are higher in periods of economic prosperity and expansion and are lower in periods of economic downturn and contraction. Companies in cyclical industries can deal with this type of volatility by implementing employee layoffs and cuts to compensateÂ during bad times and paying bonuses and hiring en masse in good times.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Cyclical industries are those that are sensitive to the business cycle. The revenue and profits of these industries are typically higher during periods of economic prosperity and expansion, and lower during periods of economic downturn and contraction. Common cyclical industries include automotive, real estate, tourism, and luxury goods.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of cyclical industries originates from the business cycle theory in economics. The business cycle refers to the cyclical fluctuations of economic activities in expansion and contraction. As early as the 19th century, economists began studying these fluctuations and found that the performance of certain industries is closely related to the overall economic conditions.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Cyclical industries can be divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Durable Goods Industry:</strong> Includes automobiles, appliances, etc. Purchases of these products can usually be postponed, so demand decreases during economic downturns.</li><li><strong>Non-Durable Goods Industry:</strong> Includes food, beverages, etc. The demand for these products is relatively stable, but high-end brands may be affected.</li><li><strong>Capital-Intensive Industry:</strong> Includes construction, heavy machinery, etc. Investment in these industries increases during economic expansion and decreases during economic contraction.</li></ul><p>The common characteristic of these industries is their high sensitivity to economic cycles, with significant fluctuations in revenue and profits.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1: Automotive Industry</strong><br/>During periods of economic prosperity, consumers have more disposable income, leading to increased car sales and higher profits for automakers. However, during economic downturns, consumers reduce large expenditures, car sales decline, and manufacturers may face inventory buildup and profit drops.</p><p><strong>Case 2: Real Estate Industry</strong><br/>During economic expansion, the real estate market is active, property prices rise, and the income of developers and construction companies increases. However, during economic contraction, the real estate market cools down, property prices fall, and developers may face the risk of cash flow problems.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>1. Why do cyclical industries' performance fluctuate with the economic cycle?</strong><br/>Because the demand for products and services in these industries is closely related to the disposable income of consumers and businesses. When the economic situation is good, demand increases; when the economic situation is poor, demand decreases.</p><p><strong>2. What are the risks of investing in cyclical industries?</strong><br/>The main risk lies in the unpredictability of the economic cycle. Investors need to have strong market judgment and risk tolerance.</p>`} id={101755} />
