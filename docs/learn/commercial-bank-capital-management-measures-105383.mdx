The Measures for the Administration of Commercial Bank Capital refer to the regulations issued by the State Council's banking supervision and management agency to regulate the management of commercial bank capital. The purpose of these regulations is to regulate the management of commercial banks' capital structure, capital adequacy ratio, and other aspects, in order to maintain the stable operation of commercial banks and the stability of the financial system.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Commercial Bank Capital Management Measures refer to the regulations issued by the State Council's banking regulatory authority to standardize the capital management of commercial banks. These regulations aim to standardize the management of commercial banks' capital structure and capital adequacy ratio to maintain the sound operation of commercial banks and the stability of the financial system.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The origin of the Commercial Bank Capital Management Measures can be traced back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when the international financial market experienced a series of turbulences, prompting countries to pay attention to bank capital management. In 1998, the People's Bank of China issued the 'Commercial Bank Capital Adequacy Ratio Management Measures,' one of China's earliest bank capital management regulations. Since then, with the continuous evolution of international financial regulatory standards, China's commercial bank capital management measures have also been continuously updated and improved.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Commercial Bank Capital Management Measures mainly include the following categories:<ul><li><strong>Core Tier 1 Capital:</strong> Includes common stock, capital reserves, and retained earnings, with the highest loss-absorbing capacity.</li><li><strong>Other Tier 1 Capital:</strong> Includes preferred stock and other capital instruments with permanence and loss-absorbing capacity.</li><li><strong>Tier 2 Capital:</strong> Includes subordinated debt and other capital instruments with lower loss-absorbing capacity.</li></ul>The characteristics of these capital categories lie in their loss-absorbing capacity and permanence, with Core Tier 1 Capital having the highest loss-absorbing capacity, while Tier 2 Capital is relatively lower.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A commercial bank found that its Core Tier 1 Capital adequacy ratio was below regulatory requirements during its annual audit. To meet the capital adequacy ratio requirements, the bank decided to increase its Core Tier 1 Capital by issuing common stock. This move not only improved the bank's capital adequacy ratio but also enhanced its risk resistance capacity.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another commercial bank chose to issue subordinated debt to supplement its Tier 2 Capital. Although subordinated debt has a lower loss-absorbing capacity than Core Tier 1 Capital, it still helps to improve the bank's overall capital adequacy ratio and meet regulatory requirements.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why do commercial banks need to maintain a high capital adequacy ratio?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> A high capital adequacy ratio helps to enhance the bank's risk resistance capacity, ensuring its sound operation during economic downturns or financial crises.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the capital adequacy ratio?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The capital adequacy ratio is the ratio of a bank's total capital to its risk-weighted assets, an important indicator of a bank's capital adequacy.</li></ul></p>`} id={105383} />
