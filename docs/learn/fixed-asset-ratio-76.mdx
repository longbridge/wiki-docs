The fixed asset ratio refers to the proportion of fixed assets to total assets in a company. Fixed assets refer to assets that are used by a company for a long term, have production capacity, and are not easily converted into cash, including buildings, machinery and equipment, and vehicles. The fixed asset ratio can reflect the scale and structure of capital investment in a company, and is of great significance for evaluating asset allocation and operational efficiency of the company.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>The fixed asset ratio refers to the proportion of a company's fixed assets to its total assets. Fixed assets are long-term assets used by a company that have productive capacity and are not easily converted into cash, including buildings, machinery, and vehicles. The fixed asset ratio reflects the scale and structure of a company's capital investment and is significant for assessing asset allocation and operational efficiency.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of the fixed asset ratio developed with the needs of modern business management and financial analysis. Early financial analysis focused mainly on current assets and short-term solvency. As companies grew and capital-intensive industries developed, the management and analysis of fixed assets became an essential part of financial analysis.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>The fixed asset ratio can be categorized based on industry and company characteristics. For example, manufacturing companies typically have a high fixed asset ratio due to the need for extensive machinery and facilities in their production processes. In contrast, service companies may have a lower fixed asset ratio as they rely more on human resources and intellectual capital. A high fixed asset ratio often indicates that a company operates in a capital-intensive industry, which may involve high depreciation costs and capital expenditure pressures.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>For instance, Tesla had a high fixed asset ratio in its early stages due to significant investments in production facilities and equipment to support electric vehicle manufacturing. As production scaled and technology advanced, Tesla's fixed asset ratio stabilized, reflecting an optimized capital structure. Another example is Amazon, which has a relatively low fixed asset ratio because its business model relies more on technology platforms and logistics networks rather than traditional heavy asset investments.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand a high fixed asset ratio as a sign of financial health. In reality, a high fixed asset ratio can lead to liquidity risks since fixed assets are not easily liquidated. Additionally, the standard for fixed asset ratios varies across industries, so investors should analyze them in the context of industry characteristics.</p>`} id={76} />
