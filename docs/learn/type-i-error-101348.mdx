The term type I error is a statistical concept that refers to the incorrect rejection of an accurate null hypothesis. Put simply, a type I error is a false positive result. Making a type I error often can't be avoided because of the degree of uncertainty involved. A null hypothesis is established during hypothesis testing before a test begins. In some cases, a type I error assumes there's no cause-and-effect relationship between the tested item and the stimuli to trigger an outcome to the test.
