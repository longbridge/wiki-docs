A mortgage rate is the percentage of interest that is charged for a home loan.Broadly speaking, mortgage rates change with the economic conditions that prevail at any given time. However, the mortgage rate that a home buyer is offered is determined by the lender and depends on the individual's credit history and financial circumstances, among other factors.The consumer decides whether to apply for a variable mortgage rate or a fixed rate. A variable rate will go up or down with the fluctuations of national borrowing costs, and alters the individual's monthly payment for better or worse. A fixed-rate mortgage remains the same for the life of the mortgage.
