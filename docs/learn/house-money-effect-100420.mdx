<p>The House Money Effect is a concept in behavioral economics that describes the tendency of individuals to take on more risk with money they perceive as having been gained easily or unexpectedly, such as winnings from gambling or unexpected windfalls. This phenomenon is based on the idea that people treat this money as less valuable than money they have earned through effort, often viewing it as “free” or “extra” money. As a result, they are more willing to gamble or spend it recklessly.</p>
