Scalping is a trading strategy geared towards profiting from minor price changes in a stock's price. Traders who implement this strategy place anywhere from 10 to a few hundred trades in a single day with the belief that small moves in stock price are easier to catch than large ones; traders who implement this strategy are known as scalpers. Many small profits can easily compound into large gains if a strict exit strategy is used to prevent large losses.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Scalping Trading</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Scalping trading is a strategy aimed at profiting from small price movements in stocks. Traders who employ this strategy can make anywhere from 10 to hundreds of trades in a single day, believing that small price fluctuations are easier to capture than large ones. These traders are known as scalpers. By using strict exit strategies to prevent large losses, many small profits can easily accumulate into significant gains.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of scalping trading originated in the early 20th century stock markets when trading technology and market information were not as advanced as they are today. With the advent of electronic trading platforms and high-speed internet, scalping trading became increasingly popular in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Scalping trading can be divided into manual scalping and automated scalping. Manual scalping relies on the trader's quick decision-making and execution skills, while automated scalping uses algorithms and trading robots to execute trades. The advantage of manual scalping is its high flexibility, but it requires strong psychological resilience and quick reflexes from the trader. Automated scalping can handle a large number of trades in a short time but requires complex programming and technical support.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A trader notices that a tech stock is fluctuating within a narrow range after the market opens. Using a scalping strategy, the trader buys when the price hits the lower limit of the range and sells when it hits the upper limit. Through multiple such operations, the trader achieves significant cumulative gains in a single day.</p><p>Case 2: An automated trading system is set with specific price fluctuation ranges and trading rules. When a stock's price fluctuates within the set range, the system automatically executes buy and sell operations. Through high-frequency trading, the system achieves multiple small profits in a short period.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. How much capital is needed for scalping trading?<br/>Answer: Scalping trading usually requires a high amount of capital because each trade yields small profits, which need to be accumulated through a large number of trades.</p><p>2. What are the risks of scalping trading?<br/>Answer: The main risks of scalping trading are market volatility and trading costs. Sudden large market movements can lead to losses. Additionally, the fees and spreads associated with high-frequency trading can affect the final profits.</p>`} id={101303} />
