Dividend irrelevance theory posits that dividends don’t have any effect on a company’s stock price. A dividend is typically a cash payment made from a company’s profits to its shareholders as a reward for investing in the company.Dividend irrelevance theory goes on to state that dividends can hurt a company’s ability to be competitive in the long term since the money would be better off reinvested in the company to generate earnings.Although there are companies that have likely opted to pay dividends instead of boosting their earnings, there are many critics of dividend irrelevance theory who believe that dividends help a company’s stock price to rise.
