An underwriter syndicate is aÂ temporary group of investment banks and broker-dealers who come together to sell new offerings of equity or debt securities to investors. The underwriter syndicate is formed and led by the lead underwriter for a security issue.When an issue is too large for a single firm to handle, an underwriter syndicate is usually formed so that the resources of all the firms can be used to orchestrate the issuance and spread out the risk. The syndicate is compensated by the underwriting spread, which is the difference between the price paid to the issuer and the price received from investors and other broker-dealers when the issuance goes public.An underwriter syndicate is also referred to as an underwriting group, banking syndicate, and investment banking syndicate.
