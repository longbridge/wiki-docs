Accrued income is the money a company has earned in the ordinary course of businessbut has yet to be received, and for which the invoice is yet to be billed to the customer.Mutual funds or other pooled assets that accumulate income over a period of time—but only pay shareholders once a year—are, by definition, accruing their income. Individual companies can also generate income without actually receiving it, which is the basis of the accrual accounting system.
