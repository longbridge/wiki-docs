A Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty.A Monte Carlo simulation is used to tackle a range of problems in many fields including investing, business, physics, and engineering.It is also referred to as a multiple probability simulation.
