Diluted earnings per share refers to the actual earnings per share of a company after issuing potential common stock. Diluted earnings per share is lower than basic earnings per share because it takes into account the impact of potential common stock that may be issued in the future.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Diluted Earnings Per Share (Diluted EPS) refers to the actual earnings per share of a company after the issuance of potential common shares. Diluted EPS is lower than basic EPS because it takes into account the impact of potential common shares that may be issued in the future. These potential common shares include convertible bonds, options, warrants, etc.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of diluted EPS originated in the mid-20th century. With the development of financial markets and the diversification of corporate financing methods, investors and analysts needed a more accurate metric to assess a company's profitability. In the 1970s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began requiring companies to disclose diluted EPS in their financial reports.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Diluted EPS mainly falls into two categories: basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS only considers currently issued common shares, while diluted EPS takes into account all potential common shares. The characteristics of diluted EPS include:</p><ul><li>More comprehensive: Considers all factors that may affect the share capital.</li><li>More conservative: Usually lower than basic EPS, providing a more conservative earnings forecast.</li><li>More complex: The calculation process is more complicated, requiring consideration of various potential equity instruments.</li></ul><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company currently has 1 million common shares and a net profit of 10 million yuan. The basic EPS is 10 yuan. If the company has 100,000 convertible bonds with a conversion price of 5 yuan per share, the diluted EPS is:</p><p>Diluted EPS = Net Profit / (Common Shares + Convertible Bonds) = 10 million yuan / (1 million shares + 100,000 shares) = 9.09 yuan</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company currently has 2 million common shares and a net profit of 20 million yuan. The basic EPS is 10 yuan. If the company has 200,000 options with an exercise price of 8 yuan, the diluted EPS is:</p><p>Diluted EPS = Net Profit / (Common Shares + Options) = 20 million yuan / (2 million shares + 200,000 shares) = 9.09 yuan</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>1. Why is diluted EPS lower than basic EPS?</strong><br/>Because diluted EPS takes into account potential common shares that may be issued in the future, which dilute the earnings of existing shareholders.</p><p><strong>2. How is diluted EPS calculated?</strong><br/>It requires dividing the net profit by the sum of common shares and all potential common shares.</p><p><strong>3. What is the significance of diluted EPS for investors?</strong><br/> Diluted EPS provides a more conservative earnings forecast, helping investors more accurately assess a company's profitability.</p>`} id={104601} />
