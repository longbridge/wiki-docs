<p>An outright option is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date. Outright options are typically categorized into two types: call options and put options. A call option grants the holder the right to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price in the future, whereas a put option grants the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price in the future. Outright options are commonly used for hedging risks or for speculative purposes, and the holder pays a premium to acquire this right.</p>
