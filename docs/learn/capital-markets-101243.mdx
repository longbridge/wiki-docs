<AIContent content={`<h2>Capital Market</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>The capital market is a channel for savings and investments between suppliers and those in need of funds. Suppliers are individuals or institutions with funds to lend or invest, typically including banks and investors. Those seeking funds in this market are businesses, governments, and individuals. The capital market connects suppliers with those seeking funds and provides a venue for trading securities, thereby improving transaction efficiency.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The origin of the capital market can be traced back to medieval Europe, where merchants and bankers began lending and investing activities. Over time, the capital market gradually developed, especially in the 17th century in the Netherlands and the UK, where stock and bond markets began to form and become regulated. In the 19th and 20th centuries, with the advancement of the Industrial Revolution and globalization, the capital market further expanded, becoming a crucial part of the modern financial system.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The capital market is mainly divided into the primary market and the secondary market.
