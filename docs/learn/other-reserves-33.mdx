Other reserves refer to the benefits that are not specifically attributed to each part of the owner's equity in accounting. These benefits belong to the enterprise itself, but have not yet been realized or recognized as realized benefits, mainly including various reserve funds and undistributed profits.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other reserves refer to the interests in a company that are not clearly attributed to specific parts of shareholders' equity during accounting. These interests belong to the company itself but have not yet been realized or recognized as realized, mainly including various reserve funds and undistributed profits.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of other reserves originated from the development of corporate accounting standards, aiming to better reflect a company's financial status. As corporate accounting systems evolved, especially in the late 20th century, companies needed to classify and report their financial status more precisely to accurately reflect their economic activities.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other reserves can be categorized into several types, including statutory surplus reserves, discretionary surplus reserves, and undistributed profits. Statutory surplus reserves are reserves extracted according to legal requirements, typically used to cover losses or expand production. Discretionary surplus reserves are reserves extracted based on the company's needs, offering greater flexibility. Undistributed profits are the portion of net profits not distributed to shareholders after deducting various costs and expenses, usually used for reinvestment or future distribution.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A publicly listed company reported a large amount of undistributed profits in its annual financial report, indicating good profitability over the past year but choosing to retain profits internally to support future expansion and investment. Case 2: Another company showed a high statutory surplus reserve in its financial report, possibly due to legal requirements for surplus extraction in recent years to ensure financial stability.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand other reserves as immediately distributable profits, whereas these reserves are typically used for long-term development and risk management. Additionally, undistributed profits do not imply a company's inability to pay dividends but rather a choice to reinvest funds.</p>`} id={33} />
