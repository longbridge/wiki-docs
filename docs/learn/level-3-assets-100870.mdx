Level 3 assets are financial assets and liabilities considered to be the most illiquidand hardest to value.Â They are not traded frequently, so it is difficult to give them a reliable and accurate market price.A fair value for these assets cannot be determined by using readily observable inputs or measures, such as market prices or models. Instead, they are calculated using estimates or risk-adjusted value ranges; methods open to interpretation.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Level 3 assets are considered the least liquid and hardest to value financial assets and liabilities. Due to their infrequent trading, it is challenging to provide reliable and accurate market prices. The fair value of Level 3 assets cannot be determined using easily observable inputs or indicators (such as market prices or models) but rather through estimates or risk-adjusted value ranges; these methods are open to interpretation.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Level 3 assets originated from financial accounting standards, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis when financial institutions needed to report the value of their assets more transparently. To better classify and assess the liquidity and valuation difficulty of assets, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced the classification of Level 3 assets.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Level 3 assets mainly include the following categories:<ul><li>Private equity investments: These investments typically do not have public market trading, and their valuation relies on internal models and assumptions.</li><li>Complex derivatives: Such as certain structured financial products, whose valuation requires complex mathematical models and assumptions.</li><li>Real estate investments: Especially those properties without an active market, whose valuation depends on the professional judgment of appraisers.</li></ul>The main characteristics of these assets are poor liquidity, high valuation difficulty, and low market transparency.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li>Case 1: An investment fund holds a large amount of private equity investments, which do not have public market prices. The fund manager needs to use internal models and assumptions for valuation. These valuations may be affected by changes in market conditions and assumptions.</li><li>Case 2: A bank holds complex structured financial products, whose valuation requires the use of complex mathematical models. Due to the lack of market transparency, these valuations may have significant uncertainty.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li>How is the fair value of Level 3 assets determined? The fair value of Level 3 assets is usually estimated through internal models and assumptions, which may be influenced by changes in market conditions and assumptions.</li><li>What are the main risks of Level 3 assets? Due to poor liquidity and high valuation difficulty, the main risks of Level 3 assets include inaccurate valuations and low market transparency.</li></ul></p>`} id={100870} />
