Level 3 assets are financial assets and liabilities considered to be the most illiquidand hardest to value.Â They are not traded frequently, so it is difficult to give them a reliable and accurate market price.A fair value for these assets cannot be determined by using readily observable inputs or measures, such as market prices or models. Instead, they are calculated using estimates or risk-adjusted value ranges; methods open to interpretation.
