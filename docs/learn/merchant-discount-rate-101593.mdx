The merchant discount rate (MDR) is a fee that merchants and other businesses must pay to a payment processing company on debit or credit card transactions. The MDR typically comes in the form of a percentage of the transaction amount. It is also referred to as a transaction discount rate (TDR) or simply a discount rate.
