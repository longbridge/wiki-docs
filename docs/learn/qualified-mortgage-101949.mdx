A qualified mortgage is a mortgage that meets certain requirements for lender protection and secondary market trading under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a significant piece of financial reform legislation passed in 2010.Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are intended to protect both borrowers and the financial system from the risky lending practices that contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007. By creating greater incentives for offering higher quality mortgage loans in both the primary and secondary markets, the goal of the act was to lower the overall risk that mortgages create in the greater financial system.
