Wealth Added Index (WAI) is a metric designed by Stern Value Managament, a consulting firm, that attempts to measure value created (or destroyed) for shareholders by a company. According to this calculation method, wealth is created only if the returns of a company, inclusive of share price gains and dividends, exceed its cost of equity.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Wealth Added Index (WAI) is a metric designed by Stern Value Management to measure the value a company creates (or destroys) for its shareholders. According to this calculation method, wealth is created only when a company's returns, including stock price growth and dividends, exceed its cost of equity.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Wealth Added Index (WAI) originated in the 1990s, proposed by Stern Value Management. The company focuses on helping businesses evaluate their financial performance through quantitative analysis. WAI, as an innovative metric, aims to more accurately reflect the actual value created for shareholders.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The Wealth Added Index has the following key characteristics:<ul><li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> WAI considers both stock price growth and dividend payouts, providing a more holistic measure of returns.</li><li><strong>Cost of Equity:</strong> WAI includes the company's cost of equity in its calculation, ensuring that wealth is only considered created when returns exceed costs.</li><li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> WAI is a dynamic metric that can adjust with market and internal company changes, reflecting the latest financial status.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ol><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose Company A's stock price grew by 10% in a given year and it paid a 2% dividend, with a cost of equity of 8%. According to WAI, the company's total return is 12% (10% + 2%), exceeding the 8% cost of equity, thus creating wealth for shareholders that year.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Company B's stock price grew by 5% in a given year and it paid a 3% dividend, with a cost of equity of 9%. According to WAI, the company's total return is 8% (5% + 3%), which is below the 9% cost of equity, thus failing to create wealth for shareholders that year.</li></ol></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>How is WAI different from other financial metrics?</strong> WAI comprehensively considers stock price growth and dividend payouts and includes the cost of equity in its calculation, making it more reflective of the actual value created for shareholders compared to traditional financial metrics.</li><li><strong>How is the cost of equity calculated?</strong> The cost of equity is typically calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which considers the risk-free rate, market risk premium, and the company's beta coefficient.</li></ul></p>`} id={101818} />
