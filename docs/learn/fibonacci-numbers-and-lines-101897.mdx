The Fibonacci sequence was developed by the Italian mathematician, Leonardo Fibonacci, in the 13th century. The sequence of numbers, starting with zero and one, is a steadily increasing series where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.Some traders believe that the Fibonacci numbers and ratios created by the sequence play an important role in finance that traders can apply using technical analysis.
