<p>The Random Walk Theory is a financial theory suggesting that stock price changes are unpredictable and follow a random walk process. This theory was initially proposed by French mathematician Louis Bachelier and later developed by American economist Paul Samuelson.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Random Walk Theory</h2><p>Random Walk Theory is a financial theory that suggests stock price movements are unpredictable and follow a random walk process. This theory was first proposed by French mathematician Louis Bachelier and later developed by American economist Paul Samuelson. The theory assumes that stock price changes are independent, and past price movements cannot be used to predict future price changes. This implies that the market is efficient, and all available information is already reflected in current prices, making it impossible for investors to achieve excess returns through technical or fundamental analysis.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The origin of Random Walk Theory dates back to 1900 when Louis Bachelier first introduced the concept in his doctoral thesis. Later, Paul Samuelson further developed the theory in the 1960s and applied it to the analysis of modern financial markets.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>The main characteristics of Random Walk Theory include:</p><ul><li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Stock price movements are random and cannot be predicted based on past prices.</li><li><strong>Market Efficiency:</strong> The market is information-efficient, and all available information is already reflected in current prices.</li><li><strong>Independent Movements:</strong> Stock price changes are independent of each other, and past price movements do not affect future prices.</li><li><strong>Challenges to Technical and Fundamental Analysis:</strong> The theory suggests that technical and fundamental analysis cannot provide consistent excess returns.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose an investor tries to predict future stock prices by analyzing past price trends. According to Random Walk Theory, this attempt is futile because stock price movements are random, and the investor cannot achieve consistent excess returns by analyzing historical data.</p><p>Case 2: A fund manager attempts to select stocks through fundamental analysis to achieve excess returns. However, according to Random Walk Theory, all public information is already reflected in stock prices, making this strategy unlikely to be consistently effective.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: Does Random Walk Theory mean that investing in stocks is completely pointless?</strong><br/>A1: Not necessarily. Random Walk Theory emphasizes that excess returns cannot be achieved through historical data or public information, but long-term investments can still profit from overall market growth.</p><p><strong>Q2: If the market is random, why do people still engage in technical and fundamental analysis?</strong><br/>A2: Despite Random Walk Theory's suggestion that these methods cannot provide consistent excess returns, many investors and analysts still believe they can find short-term opportunities in the market through these analyses.</p>`} id={102118} />
