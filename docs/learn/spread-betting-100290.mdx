<p>Spread Betting is a form of financial speculation where investors place bets on the price movement of an asset without actually owning the asset. The profit or loss in spread betting depends on the extent of the price movement rather than just the buy-sell difference. Spread Betting typically involves leverage, which magnifies both potential gains and risks. It is widely used in markets such as stocks, forex, commodities, and indices.</p>
