<p>Noncallable refers to certain bonds or other financial instruments that cannot be redeemed or bought back by the issuer before a specified date. This means that investors can hold the instrument for its entire term without the risk of the issuer redeeming it early, which could force the investor to reinvest the funds at a potentially lower interest rate. Noncallable bonds typically offer higher interest rates to compensate investors for the lack of liquidity and the flexibility of early redemption. For investors, the noncallable feature provides greater certainty of returns, as they can expect to receive fixed interest income for the entire term of the bond.</p>
