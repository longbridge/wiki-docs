A wasting trust is a fund whose assets have been depleted over time as plan participants receive their required payouts and no new money is paid in. The term may also be applied to income trusts which hold depleting assets, such as oil and gas.In either case, the principle held in the trust is declining in value.Â The trust will continue to pay out until its assets are exhausted.
