The 10-year yield refers to the annualized yield of fixed-income products such as government bonds within a 10-year period. It is one of the important indicators for measuring the long-term interest rate level in the bond market and also a reference indicator for evaluating economic development and inflation expectations. An increase in the 10-year yield usually means a decrease in bond prices and an increase in investors' expectations of economic growth and inflation, while a decrease in the 10-year yield indicates the opposite.
