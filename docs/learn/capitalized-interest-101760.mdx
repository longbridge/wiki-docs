Capitalized interest is the cost of borrowing to acquire or construct a long-term asset. Unlike an interest expense incurred for any other purpose, capitalized interest is not expensed immediately on the income statement of a company's financial statements. Instead, firms capitalize it, meaning the interest paid increases the cost basis of the related long-term asset on the balance sheet. Capitalized interest shows up in installments on a company's income statement through periodic depreciation expense recorded on the associated long-term asset over its useful life.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Capitalized Interest</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Capitalized interest refers to the cost of borrowing funds to acquire or construct long-term assets. Unlike interest expenses incurred for other purposes, capitalized interest is not immediately expensed on the company's income statement. Instead, it is capitalized, meaning the interest paid is added to the cost basis of the related long-term asset. Capitalized interest is reflected on the company's income statement through periodic depreciation expenses, which are recorded based on the expected useful life of the related long-term asset.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of capitalized interest originated from the evolution of accounting standards, particularly in the mid-20th century, as companies increased their investments in long-term assets, necessitating greater accuracy and transparency in financial reporting. Key events include the issuance of relevant standards by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Capitalized interest can be categorized into two main types: interest related to self-constructed assets and interest related to purchased assets. Capitalized interest for self-constructed assets typically involves more complex calculations, as it requires consideration of borrowing costs during the construction period. In contrast, capitalized interest for purchased assets is relatively straightforward, usually involving the direct inclusion of borrowing costs at the time of purchase.</p><p>Characteristics include: 1. Capitalized interest increases the book value of the asset; 2. It is gradually amortized through depreciation expenses, impacting the company's income statement; 3. It requires adherence to strict accounting standards and regulations.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: A company is constructing a new production plant, with an expected construction period of two years. The company borrows 50 million yuan for this purpose, with an annual interest rate of 5%. During the construction period, the company needs to pay 2.5 million yuan in interest each year. This interest is not immediately expensed but is capitalized, increasing the cost basis of the plant. Once the plant is completed, this capitalized interest will be gradually amortized through depreciation expenses in future financial statements.</p><p>Case 2: A company purchases a large piece of equipment with a purchase cost of 10 million yuan and borrows 5 million yuan for this purpose, with an annual interest rate of 4%. The interest of 200,000 yuan paid at the time of purchase will be capitalized, increasing the cost basis of the equipment. The total cost of the equipment will become 10.2 million yuan, and it will be gradually amortized through depreciation expenses over the equipment's useful life.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. Why capitalize interest? Capitalizing interest can more accurately reflect the actual cost of the asset and gradually amortize it through depreciation expenses, avoiding a large one-time expense impact on the financial statements.</p><p>2. How is capitalized interest calculated? Calculating capitalized interest requires considering the loan amount, interest rate, and borrowing period, following relevant accounting standards.</p><p>3. Is capitalized interest applicable to all assets? No, capitalized interest typically applies only to long-term assets, such as buildings and equipment.</p>`} id={101760} />
