Income smoothing uses accounting techniques to level out fluctuations in net income from one period to the next. Companies indulge in this practice because investors are generally willing to pay a premium for stocks with steady and predictable earnings streams as opposed to stocks whose earnings are subject to more volatile patterns, which can be regarded as riskier.Income smoothing is not illegal if the process follows generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Talented accountants are able to adjust financial books in an above-board way to ensure the legality of income smoothing. However, many times income smoothing is done under fraudulent methods.
