<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Bretton Woods Agreement was negotiated in July 1944 at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, by representatives from 44 countries. The agreement established the Bretton Woods System, a fixed exchange rate system where the US dollar was pegged to gold, and other currencies were pegged to the US dollar.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The Bretton Woods Agreement was signed in the context of the imminent end of World War II, with countries seeking to establish a stable international monetary system to promote global economic recovery and development. In July 1944, representatives from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods and ultimately reached this agreement.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The core feature of the Bretton Woods System was the fixed exchange rate system. Specifically, the US dollar was pegged to gold at $35 per ounce, and other currencies were pegged to the US dollar. The advantage of this system was the stability of exchange rates, which facilitated international trade and investment growth. However, its drawback was that countries had to maintain sufficient dollar reserves to keep their currencies stable, which limited their monetary policy autonomy to some extent.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. Under the Bretton Woods System, Japan experienced rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s. With the yen pegged to the dollar, Japan enjoyed a stable exchange rate environment, which promoted exports and economic development. 2. In the late 1960s, due to the Vietnam War and domestic economic issues, the US faced increasing pressure to devalue the dollar. In 1971, President Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold, marking the end of the Bretton Woods System.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why did the Bretton Woods System end? The main reason was that the US could not maintain the fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold, leading to the system's collapse. 2. What was the impact of the end of the Bretton Woods System on the global economy? Its end led to the emergence of the floating exchange rate system, increasing exchange rate uncertainty but also giving countries more monetary policy autonomy.</p>`} id={102702} />
