At the money (ATM) is a situation where an option's strike price is identical to the current market price of the underlying security. An ATM option has a delta of ±0.50, positive if it is a call, negative for a put.Both call and put options can be simultaneously ATM. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at $75, then the XYZ 75 call option is ATM and so is the XYZ 75 put option. ATM options have no intrinsic value, but will still have extrinsic or time value prior to expiration, and may be contrasted with either in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM) options.

<AIContent content={`<h2>At-the-Money (ATM) Options</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>At-the-money (ATM) options refer to options where the strike price is exactly equal to the current market price of the underlying security. The delta of an ATM option is ±0.50, positive for call options and negative for put options. Both call and put options can be ATM simultaneously. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at $75, then both XYZ 75 call options and XYZ 75 put options are considered ATM options.

Both XYZ 100 call options and XYZ 100 put options are ATM options. If an investor believes XYZ's stock price will rise, they can buy the XYZ 100 call option; if they believe the stock price will fall, they can buy the XYZ 100 put option.</p><p>Case 2: During a period of high market volatility, Investor A buys an ATM call option for ABC company, currently priced at $50, while Investor B buys an ATM put option with the same strike price. As the market fluctuates, both Investor A and B can trade based on the time value of their ATM options to make a profit.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1.
