The supervisory board refers to an institution established in the corporate governance structure of some countries. Its responsibility is to supervise the company's management and decision-making processes, ensuring that the company's management fulfills its duties legally and in compliance. The supervisory board is usually elected by the company's shareholders and its members are independent of the company's management. They are responsible for supervising and evaluating the company's operations and protecting the interests of shareholders. The supervisory board plays an important role in corporate governance, providing effective oversight and constraints, and can enhance the transparency and sense of responsibility of the company.
