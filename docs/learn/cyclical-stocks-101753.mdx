A cyclical stock is a stock that's price is affected by macroeconomic or systematic changes in the overall economy. Cyclical stocks are known for following the cycles of an economy through expansion, peak, recession, and recovery. Most cyclical stocks involve companies that sell consumer discretionary items that consumers buy more during a booming economy but spend less on during a recession.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Cyclical stocks are those whose prices are influenced by macroeconomic conditions or overall economic changes. These stocks are known for following the phases of economic expansion, peak, recession, and recovery. Most cyclical stocks involve companies that sell discretionary consumer goods, which consumers buy more of during economic booms and less of during economic downturns.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of cyclical stocks originated from the study of economic cycles. Economists observed that the performance of certain industries' companies is closely related to economic cycles. Over time, investors began to notice the relationship between the price fluctuations of these stocks and changes in economic conditions, categorizing them as cyclical stocks.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>Cyclical stocks can be divided into several categories, including durable consumer goods (e.g., automobiles, appliances), non-durable consumer goods (e.g., clothing, food), and capital goods (e.g., machinery). The common characteristic of these stocks is that their demand increases during economic booms and decreases during recessions. Durable consumer goods have a long lifespan and low purchase frequency, so consumers often delay purchases during economic downturns. Non-durable consumer goods are daily necessities, but consumers may buy more high-end or branded products during economic booms. Capital goods are equipment and machinery purchased by businesses during expansion periods, with demand decreasing during recessions.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p>Case 1: The automotive industry. Stocks of automobile manufacturers are typically cyclical because cars are high-priced durable goods. During economic booms, consumers have more disposable income and are more willing to buy new cars, leading to increased sales and profits for automakers, and rising stock prices. During economic downturns, consumers cut back on large expenditures, car sales decline, and stock prices fall.</p><p>Case 2: The tourism industry. Stocks of tourism companies are also cyclical. During economic booms, consumers have more spare money and time for travel, increasing the revenue and profits of tourism companies, and driving up stock prices. During economic downturns, consumers reduce non-essential spending, travel demand drops, and tourism company stock prices fall.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p>Question 1: How to identify cyclical stocks?<br/>Answer: Investors can identify cyclical stocks by observing whether a company's products or services are closely related to economic cycles. If a company's sales and profits significantly increase during economic booms and significantly decrease during recessions, its stock is likely cyclical.</p><p>Question 2: What are the risks of investing in cyclical stocks?<br/>Answer: The main risk of investing in cyclical stocks is the unpredictability of economic cycles. If an investor buys cyclical stocks during an economic peak and the economy suddenly enters a recession, stock prices may plummet. Therefore, investors need to closely monitor economic indicators and market trends to make more informed investment decisions.</p>`} id={101753} />
