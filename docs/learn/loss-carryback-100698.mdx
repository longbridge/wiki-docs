<p>Loss Carryback refers to the practice where a business can apply a net operating loss (NOL) incurred in the current year to previous tax years' taxable income, thereby potentially obtaining a tax refund for taxes paid in those prior years. This mechanism provides businesses with immediate cash flow relief during tough economic times. The specific rules and allowable periods for loss carryback vary by country. For example, in the United States, businesses can carry back NOLs to the previous two tax years. It is important to distinguish loss carryback from loss carryforward, which involves applying the NOL to future taxable income to reduce future tax liabilities.</p>
