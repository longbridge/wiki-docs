Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. Portfolio turnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the number of securities sold (whichever is less) over a particular period, divided by the total net asset value (NAV) of the fund. The measurement is usually reported for a 12-month time period.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Portfolio turnover rate measures the frequency at which a fund manager buys and sells assets within a fund over a specific period. It is calculated by dividing the total amount of new securities purchased or the amount of securities sold (whichever is lesser) by the fund's total net asset value (NAV). This measure is typically reported over a 12-month period.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of portfolio turnover rate originated in the mid-20th century when investors and regulatory bodies began to focus on the impact of fund managers' trading activities on fund performance and costs. Over time, this metric has become an important tool for assessing fund management efficiency and trading costs.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Portfolio turnover rate can be categorized into high turnover and low turnover. High turnover usually indicates frequent trading by the fund manager, which may lead to higher trading costs and tax implications but could also reflect an active management strategy. Low turnover indicates less trading activity, typically associated with lower trading costs and tax implications, suitable for long-term investment strategies.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> Case 1: A fund purchased $5 million worth of securities and sold $3 million worth of securities over the past 12 months. The fund's total NAV is $10 million. The portfolio turnover rate is $3 million (whichever is lesser) divided by $10 million, which is 30%. Case 2: Another fund purchased $2 million worth of securities and sold $4 million worth of securities over the same period. The fund's total NAV is $8 million. The portfolio turnover rate is $2 million (whichever is lesser) divided by $8 million, which is 25%.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> Investors often ask, does a high portfolio turnover rate mean better fund performance? The answer is not necessarily. High turnover can lead to high trading costs and tax implications, which may not translate into better fund performance. Another common question is, is a low turnover rate more suitable for long-term investment? Generally, funds with low turnover rates are more suitable for long-term investment because they have lower trading costs and tax implications.</p>`} id={101777} />
