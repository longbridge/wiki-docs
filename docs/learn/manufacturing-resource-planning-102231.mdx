Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) is an integrated information system used by businesses. Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) evolved from early Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) systems by including the integration of additional data, such as employee and financial needs.The system is designed to centralize, integrate, and process information for effective decision making in scheduling, design engineering, inventory management, and cost control in manufacturing.Both MRP and MRP II are seen as predecessors to Enterprise resource planning (ERP), which is a process whereby a company, often a manufacturer, manages and integrates the important parts of its business.An ERP management information system integrates areas such as planning, purchasing, inventory, sales, marketing, finance, and human resources. ERP is most frequently used in the context of software, with many large applications having been developed to help companies implement ERP.
