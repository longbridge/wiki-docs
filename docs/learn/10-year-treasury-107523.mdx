10-year government bond refers to a government bond with a maturity date of 10 years. Government bonds are bonds issued by the government, representing the government borrowing from bondholders and promising to repay the principal and pay interest on the maturity date. 10-year government bonds are long-term bonds with a maturity date of 10 years, and investors can purchase these bonds to receive fixed interest income. Due to the fact that government bonds are issued by the government, their default risk is relatively low and they are considered a relatively safe investment choice.
