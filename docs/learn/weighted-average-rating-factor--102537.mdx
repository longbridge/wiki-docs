The weighted average rating factor (WARF) is aÂ measure that is used by credit rating companies to indicate the credit quality of a portfolio. This measure aggregates the credit ratings of the portfolio's holdings into a single rating. WARFs are most often calculated for collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).
