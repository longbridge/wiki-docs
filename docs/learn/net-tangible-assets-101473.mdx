In other words, NTA focuses on physical assets such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), as well as inventory and cash instruments. Physical assets are anything listed on a company's balance sheet, while intangible assets are those without a physical form.

By analyzing the value and turnover rate of the inventory, investors can assess the company's sales capability and market demand.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q:</strong> How is NTA different from total assets?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Total assets include all of a company's assets, both intangible (such as goodwill, patents, etc.) and physical, while NTA only includes physical assets, minus intangible assets and liabilities.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is NTA important to investors?<br/><strong>A:</strong> NTA provides the value of a company's actual physical assets, helping to assess the company's financial health and risk-bearing capacity.</p>`} id={101473} />
