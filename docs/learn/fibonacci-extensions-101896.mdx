Fibonacci extensions are a tool that traders can use to establish profit targets or estimate how far a price may travel after a pullback is finished. Extension levels are also possible areas where the price may reverse.Drawn as connections to points on a chart, these levels are based on Fibonacci ratios (as percentages). Common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Fibonacci Extension</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Fibonacci extension is a tool used by traders to determine profit targets or estimate how far the price may move after a retracement. Extension levels can also indicate areas where the price might reverse. These levels are plotted on the chart by connecting points based on Fibonacci ratios (expressed as percentages). Common Fibonacci extension levels include 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of Fibonacci extension originates from the Fibonacci sequence introduced by the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century. Ratios derived from the Fibonacci sequence, such as 0.618 and 1.618, are widely used in financial market technical analysis to predict price movements.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Fibonacci extensions are mainly categorized as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>61.8% Extension:</strong> One of the most common Fibonacci extension levels, typically used to predict initial price targets.</li><li><strong>100% Extension:</strong> Indicates a complete price movement of the same magnitude as the initial move.</li><li><strong>161.8% Extension:</strong> A more aggressive target, often used in strong trends.</li><li><strong>200% and 261.8% Extensions:</strong> These are more extreme targets, suitable for very strong trends.</li></ul><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Suppose a stock rises from $10 to $20 and then retraces to $15. Traders can use the Fibonacci extension tool to predict the next price target. According to Fibonacci extension, the 61.8% extension level is around $23, the 100% extension level is around $25, and the 161.8% extension level is around $30.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> In the forex market, suppose EUR/USD rises from 1.1000 to 1.1500 and then retraces to 1.1250. Using the Fibonacci extension tool, traders can predict the next price target. The 61.8% extension level is around 1.1750, the 100% extension level is around 1.2000, and the 161.8% extension level is around 1.2500.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p><strong>Q1: Are Fibonacci extensions always accurate?</strong><br/>A1: Fibonacci extensions are a predictive tool and do not guarantee 100% accuracy. They should be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools.</p><p><strong>Q2: How to choose the starting and ending points?</strong><br/>A2: The starting and ending points are usually chosen as prominent highs and lows, ensuring these points have significant price movements on the chart.</p>`} id={101896} />
