Fibonacci extensions are a tool that traders can use to establish profit targets or estimate how far a price may travel after a pullback is finished. Extension levels are also possible areas where the price may reverse.Drawn as connections to points on a chart, these levels are based on Fibonacci ratios (as percentages). Common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%.
