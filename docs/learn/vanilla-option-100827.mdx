A vanilla option is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a given timeframe. A vanilla option is a call option or put option that has no special or unusual features. Such options are standardized if traded on an exchange such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Plain Vanilla Options</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Plain vanilla options are financial instruments that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time period. These options are standard call or put options without any special or unusual features. They are standardized when traded on exchanges, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The history of options can be traced back to ancient Greece, but the modern options market began with the establishment of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973. The CBOE introduced standardized option contracts and a centralized clearing mechanism, making options trading more transparent and efficient.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Plain vanilla options are primarily divided into two categories: call options and put options. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time period, while a put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time period. Characteristics of plain vanilla options include standardized contracts, exchange trading, high liquidity, and high transparency.</p><h3>Specific Cases</h3><p>Case 1: Suppose Investor A buys a call option on Apple Inc. stock with a strike price of $150 and a three-month expiration. If Apple's stock price rises to $160 within three months, Investor A can choose to buy the stock at $150, making a profit of $10 (excluding the option premium).</p><p>Case 2: Investor B buys a put option on the S&P 500 index with a strike price of 4000 points and a six-month expiration. If the S&P 500 index falls to 3900 points within six months, Investor B can choose to sell at 4000 points, making a profit of 100 points (excluding the option premium).</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. What is an option premium? The option premium is the fee paid to purchase the option, similar to an insurance premium.</p><p>2. Must the option be exercised at expiration? No, the option holder has the right but not the obligation to exercise the option.</p><p>3. How do plain vanilla options differ from other derivatives?
