Unlocked shares refer to the situation where shareholders of a listed company can freely sell their shares after the share lock-up period expires. The increase in unlocked shares may lead to a decline in stock prices, as the number of stocks available for sale in the market increases, thereby increasing selling pressure.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Unlocked shares refer to the situation where shareholders of a listed company can freely sell their shares after the lock-up period expires. The increase in unlocked shares may lead to a decline in stock prices because the supply of stocks in the market increases, thereby increasing selling pressure.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of unlocked shares originates from regulatory measures in the securities market, aimed at preventing shareholders of listed companies from massively selling shares in the early stages of listing, causing market volatility. Typically, the lock-up period ranges from 1 to 3 years, determined by regulatory authorities and the company's listing agreement.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Unlocked shares are mainly divided into two categories: 1. <em>Initial Public Offering (IPO) original shareholder unlock</em>, where shares held by original shareholders at the time of the company's listing are unlocked after the lock-up period; 2. <em>Additional issuance unlock</em>, where new shares issued by the company to raise funds are unlocked after the lock-up period. IPO original shareholder unlock usually has a greater impact on the market due to the large number of shares involved.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. A company had its major shareholders' shares locked up for three years at the time of listing. After three years, these shares were unlocked, allowing shareholders to sell freely. Due to the large number of unlocked shares, market expectations of increased selling pressure led to a decline in stock prices before the unlocking. 2. Another company raised funds through additional issuance of new shares, which were locked up for one year. After one year, the new shares were unlocked, increasing the supply of stocks in the market and causing short-term price fluctuations.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. <em>Will unlocked shares definitely lead to a decline in stock prices?</em> Not necessarily. Although unlocked shares increase market supply, if market demand is strong, stock prices may not decline. 2. <em>How should investors respond to unlocked shares?</em> Investors should pay attention to the number of unlocked shares and market sentiment, reasonably assess the impact of unlocking on stock prices, and avoid blindly following the trend.</p>`} id={104241} />
