A stop order is one of the three main order types you will encounter in the market: stop, market, and limit. A stop order is always executed in the direction that the price is moving. For instance, if the market is moving lower, the stop order is set to sell at a pre-set price below the current market price. Alternatively, if the price is moving higher, the stop order will be to buy once the security reaches a pre-set price above the current market price.There are several types of stop orders that can be employed depending on your position and your overall market strategy. Here's a review of the various types of stop orders and how they function relative to your trading position in the market.
