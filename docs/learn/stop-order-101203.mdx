<p>A Stop Order is a type of trading order used to automatically execute a buy or sell operation when the market price reaches a preset level. There are two types of stop orders:<br/>Stop Buy Order: This order is executed automatically when the market price rises to the preset trigger price. It is commonly used to buy when the price breaks through a certain level, preventing missing out on further upward movement.<br/>Stop Sell Order: This order is executed automatically when the market price falls to the preset trigger price. It is typically used to limit losses or protect existing profits.</p>
