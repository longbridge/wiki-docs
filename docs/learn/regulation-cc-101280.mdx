Regulation CC is one of the banking regulations set forth by the Federal Reserve. Regulation CC implements the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) of 1987 and the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21). These laws set specific requirements for the timely availability of deposits that are made by customers into transaction accounts. These laws addressed the lengths of hold times banks previously placed on checks deposited by customers.
