<p>Bonds payable refers to the debt that a company is obligated to pay after issuing bonds to raise funds, according to the terms of the bond agreement.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Bonds payable refer to the debt that a company must pay after issuing bonds to raise funds, as stipulated in the bond contract. It represents a long-term liability of the company to the bondholders, typically including periodic interest payments and the repayment of principal at maturity.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Bonds as a financing tool originated from government and corporate efforts to raise large sums of money through the issuance of securities. The earliest bonds can be traced back to the city-states of medieval Italy, while modern corporate bonds became widespread during the 19th-century Industrial Revolution.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Bonds payable can be categorized into various types, including fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate bonds, and zero-coupon bonds. Fixed-rate bonds pay a constant interest rate throughout their term, suitable for investors seeking stable cash flows. Floating-rate bonds have interest rates that adjust with market rates, appealing to investors sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Zero-coupon bonds pay all interest and principal at maturity, ideal for investors who do not need regular interest income.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: In 2013, Apple Inc. issued $17 billion in bonds, marking the largest corporate bond issuance at the time. Apple used these funds for stock buybacks and dividend payments, highlighting the importance of bonds payable in corporate capital structure. Case 2: In 2020, Tesla Inc. issued $5 billion in convertible bonds, which allow holders to convert the bonds into company stock under certain conditions, helping Tesla raise funds without diluting shareholder equity.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face with bonds payable include interest rate risk and credit risk. Rising interest rates can lead to a decline in bond prices, while a deterioration in the issuing company's creditworthiness can lead to default risk. Investors should carefully assess the company's financial health and market interest rate trends.</p>`} id={104} />
