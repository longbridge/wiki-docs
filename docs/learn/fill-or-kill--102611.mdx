Fill or kill (FOK) is a conditional type of time-in-force order used in securities trading that instructs a brokerage to execute a transaction immediately and completely or not at all. This type of order is most oftenÂ used by active traders and is usually for a large quantity of stock. The order must be filled in its entirety or else canceled (killed).A FOK is essentially an all-or-none (AON) and immediate-or-cancel order (IOC) combined.
