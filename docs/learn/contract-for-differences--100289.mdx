<p>A Contract For Differences (CFD) is a financial derivative that allows traders to profit from price movements of an asset without actually owning the asset. The profit or loss in a CFD is determined by the difference between the buy price and the sell price of the asset. Traders can profit by going long (buying) or short (selling). CFD trading typically involves leverage, meaning traders only need to deposit a small percentage of the total trade value, which amplifies potential gains and risks. CFDs are widely used in markets such as stocks, forex, commodities, and indices.</p>
