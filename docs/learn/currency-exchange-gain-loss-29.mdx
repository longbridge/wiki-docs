Exchange gain or loss refers to the gain or loss caused by exchange rate fluctuations in the process of foreign currency exchange. When a company engages in foreign currency exchange, fluctuations in exchange rates may result in differences between the exchanged amount and the original amount, and these differences are called exchange gain or loss. When preparing financial statements, companies need to include exchange gain or loss in the income statement to reflect the gain or loss incurred during the process of foreign currency exchange.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Foreign Exchange Gain or Loss</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Foreign exchange gain or loss refers to the profit or loss incurred by a company during the process of currency exchange due to fluctuations in exchange rates. When a company exchanges foreign currency, the amount received may differ from the original amount due to exchange rate changes, resulting in a foreign exchange gain or loss. Companies need to include foreign exchange gains or losses in their income statements when preparing financial reports to reflect the impact of currency exchange on their financial performance.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The concept of foreign exchange gain or loss emerged with the increase in international trade and cross-border investments. In early international trade, exchange rate fluctuations had a minor impact on transactions. However, with the acceleration of global economic integration, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on corporate financial status became more significant. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s, the floating exchange rate system became prevalent, making foreign exchange gain or loss an important aspect of corporate financial management.</p><h3>Categories and Characteristics</h3><p>Foreign exchange gain or loss can be categorized into realized and unrealized gains or losses. Realized foreign exchange gain or loss occurs when a company actually exchanges foreign currency, while unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss refers to the book profit or loss arising from holding foreign currency assets or liabilities due to exchange rate changes.</p><p>The characteristic of realized foreign exchange gain or loss is its direct impact on a company's cash flow, usually recognized when the foreign currency transaction is completed. Unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss mainly affects the company's financial statements, reflected in the balance sheet and income statement, but does not directly impact cash flow.</p><h3>Case Studies</h3><p>Case 1: An export company receives $1 million in payment on January 1, 2024, at an exchange rate of 1 USD to 6.5 CNY. On March 1, 2024, the company exchanges the dollars for CNY at an exchange rate of 1 USD to 6.3 CNY. Due to the exchange rate change, the company incurs a foreign exchange loss of 200,000 CNY ($1 million * (6.5 - 6.3)).</p><p>Case 2: A multinational company holds €1 million in accounts receivable on January 1, 2024, with an exchange rate of 1 EUR to 7.8 CNY. By December 31, 2024, the exchange rate changes to 1 EUR to 8.0 CNY. Although the company has not yet received the payment, it records an unrealized foreign exchange gain of 200,000 CNY (€1 million * (8.0 - 7.8)) on its books due to the exchange rate change.</p><h3>Common Questions</h3><p>1. How can companies manage foreign exchange gain or loss?<br/>Companies can use financial derivatives (such as forward contracts and options) to hedge against exchange rate risks, thereby reducing the volatility of foreign exchange gains or losses.</p><p>2. Does foreign exchange gain or loss affect a company's taxes?<br/>Foreign exchange gain or loss affects a company's taxable income and therefore needs to be adjusted accordingly during tax filing.</p>`} id={29} />
