Exchange gain or loss refers to the gain or loss caused by exchange rate fluctuations in the process of foreign currency exchange. When a company engages in foreign currency exchange, fluctuations in exchange rates may result in differences between the exchanged amount and the original amount, and these differences are called exchange gain or loss. When preparing financial statements, companies need to include exchange gain or loss in the income statement to reflect the gain or loss incurred during the process of foreign currency exchange.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Foreign exchange gain or loss refers to the profit or loss that a company experiences during the currency exchange process due to fluctuations in exchange rates. When a company exchanges foreign currency, the changes in exchange rates may lead to a difference between the exchanged amount and the original amount, which is known as foreign exchange gain or loss. Companies need to include this in their income statements when preparing financial reports to reflect the gains or losses incurred during foreign currency exchanges.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of foreign exchange gain or loss emerged with the increase in international trade and cross-border investments. As globalization progressed, companies increasingly engaged in international markets, making foreign currency transactions commonplace. In the late 20th century, with the liberalization of foreign exchange markets and floating exchange rates, foreign exchange gain or loss became a significant part of corporate financial management.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Foreign exchange gain or loss can be categorized into realized and unrealized types. Realized foreign exchange gain or loss occurs during actual foreign currency transactions, while unrealized gain or loss refers to book gains or losses due to exchange rate fluctuations. Realized gains or losses directly affect a company's cash flow, whereas unrealized gains or losses impact the company's book value. Companies must handle these two types of gains or losses according to different accounting standards.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A multinational company purchased raw materials worth $1 million at an exchange rate of 1 USD to 6.5 RMB at the beginning of 2023. By the end of the year, the exchange rate changed to 1 USD to 6.8 RMB, resulting in a foreign exchange loss of 300,000 RMB recorded in the company's financial statements. Case 2: An export company signed a contract in 2024 settled in euros, with a contract amount of 1 million euros. At the time, the exchange rate was 1 euro to 7.8 RMB, and upon delivery, the rate changed to 1 euro to 8.0 RMB, resulting in a foreign exchange gain of 200,000 RMB for the company.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand foreign exchange gain or loss as merely a book entry, overlooking its actual impact on cash flow. Additionally, companies may face challenges in predicting exchange rate movements, increasing the uncertainty of foreign exchange gain or loss. To mitigate risks, companies can use financial instruments such as futures and options for hedging.</p>`} id={29} />
