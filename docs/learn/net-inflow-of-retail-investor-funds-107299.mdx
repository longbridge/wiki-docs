The net inflow of funds in the middle market refers to the net inflow of funds from middle-market investors in the stock market over a certain period of time. The net inflow of funds in the middle market is calculated by subtracting the net inflow of funds from the purchase of stocks by middle-market investors from the net inflow of funds from the sale of stocks. The net inflow of funds in the middle market can be used to analyze the views and emotions of middle-market investors on the stock market and to predict the trend of the stock market. If the net inflow of funds in the middle market is positive, it means that the net inflow of funds from middle-market investors buying stocks is greater than the net inflow of funds from selling stocks, indicating that middle-market investors have an optimistic attitude towards the stock market. If the net inflow of funds in the middle market is negative, it means that the net inflow of funds from middle-market investors selling stocks is greater than the net inflow of funds from buying stocks, indicating that middle-market investors have a pessimistic attitude towards the stock market.
