A pledged asset is an asset that is used by a lender to secure a debt or loan and can include cash, stocks, bonds, and other equity or securities. A pledged asset is collateral held by a lender in return for lending funds.Â Pledged assets can reduce the down payment that is typically required for a loan as well as reduces the interest rate charged.
