Relevant cost is a managerial accounting term that describes avoidable costs that are incurred only when making specific business decisions. The concept of relevant cost is used to eliminate unnecessary data that could complicate the decision-making process. As an example, relevant cost is used to determine whether to sell or keep a business unit.The opposite of a relevant cost is a sunk cost, which has already been incurred regardless of the outcome of the current decision.

These costs are crucial in the decision-making process as they directly impact the final choice.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of relevant cost originated in managerial accounting to help businesses eliminate unnecessary data interference during decision-making.
