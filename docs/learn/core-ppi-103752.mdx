<p>The Core Producer Price Index (Core PPI) measures the changes in the prices of goods and services paid by producers during the production process, excluding the prices of food and energy, which are more volatile. Core PPI is an important inflation indicator, used to exclude some unstable factors. By removing these factors, it provides a more accurate reflection of underlying price trends.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Core Producer Price Index (Core PPI) measures the changes in prices that producers pay for goods and services during production, excluding volatile items such as food and energy prices. Core PPI is an important inflation indicator, used to exclude some unstable factors, providing a more accurate reflection of underlying price trends.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Core PPI originated in the mid-20th century. As economists and policymakers delved deeper into inflation studies, they found that food and energy prices were highly volatile and could obscure changes in other goods and services prices. Therefore, Core PPI was introduced to provide a more stable and reliable measure of inflation.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Core PPI is mainly divided into two categories: Goods Core PPI and Services Core PPI.<ul><li><strong>Goods Core PPI:</strong> Includes price changes of raw materials and intermediate products used in manufacturing, mining, and other production processes.</li><li><strong>Services Core PPI:</strong> Includes price changes in service industries such as transportation, warehousing, wholesale, and retail.</li></ul>The characteristic of Core PPI is that it excludes the volatility of food and energy prices, thus better reflecting long-term price trends, making it suitable for formulating long-term economic policies.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> In a particular year, food and energy prices fluctuated sharply due to natural disasters and international situations, but Core PPI showed that prices of other goods and services remained relatively stable. This helped policymakers determine that the overall economy was not experiencing severe inflation.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> A manufacturing company discovered through Core PPI data that its production costs were rising annually, but food and energy prices were highly volatile. By adjusting production strategies and supply chain management, the company successfully controlled costs.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Why exclude food and energy prices?</strong> Food and energy prices are highly volatile and are easily affected by seasonal and international market factors. Excluding these factors provides a more accurate reflection of underlying price changes.</li><li><strong>What is the difference between Core PPI and Overall PPI?</strong> Overall PPI includes price changes for all goods and services, while Core PPI excludes the volatility of food and energy prices, better reflecting long-term price trends.</li></ul></p>`} id={103752} />
