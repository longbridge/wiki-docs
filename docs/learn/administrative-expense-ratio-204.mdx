The management expense ratio refers to the proportion of management expenses to total operating income. This ratio can be used to evaluate the relative level of management expenses, and a high management expense ratio may indicate excessive management expenses or insufficient income. Generally, a lower management expense ratio may be beneficial to a company's profitability.
