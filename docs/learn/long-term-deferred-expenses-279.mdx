<p>Long-term deferred expenses refer to the expenses incurred by a company after purchasing long-term assets or assuming a defined obligation. They are gradually recorded as costs or expenses over a certain amortization period. Long-term deferred expenses include acquisition costs, development costs, patent costs, trademark costs, lease costs, mineral rights exploration costs, etc. Long-term deferred expenses are listed as assets on the balance sheet, reflecting the costs paid in advance for long-term benefits.</p>

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Long-term deferred expenses refer to the costs incurred by an enterprise after purchasing long-term assets or assuming certain obligations, which are amortized over a specified period and included in costs or expenses. These expenses include acquisition costs, development costs, patent fees, trademark fees, leasehold fees, and mining exploration costs. Long-term deferred expenses are listed as assets on the balance sheet, reflecting the costs pre-paid by the enterprise to obtain long-term benefits.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of long-term deferred expenses originates from the matching principle in accounting, which states that expenses should be matched with the revenues they generate. As business activities become more complex, enterprises need to pay large sums at different points in time, and the benefits of these expenses may be realized over multiple accounting periods in the future. Therefore, the treatment method for long-term deferred expenses emerged to more accurately reflect the financial status and operating results of the enterprise.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Long-term deferred expenses can be categorized as follows:<ul><li><strong>Acquisition Costs:</strong> Costs for purchasing equipment, buildings, and other long-term assets.</li><li><strong>Development Costs:</strong> Costs for new product development, market development, etc.</li><li><strong>Patent Fees:</strong> Costs for purchasing or applying for patents.</li><li><strong>Trademark Fees:</strong> Costs for registering trademarks.</li><li><strong>Leasehold Fees:</strong> Prepaid rent for long-term lease contracts.</li><li><strong>Mining Exploration Costs:</strong> Costs for exploring mineral resources.</li></ul>Common characteristics of these expenses include:<ul><li>Large amounts and one-time payments.</li><li>Benefits realized over multiple future accounting periods.</li><li>Need to be amortized over a specified period and included in costs or expenses.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> An enterprise purchases a production machine worth 1 million yuan at the beginning of 2024, with an expected useful life of 10 years.
