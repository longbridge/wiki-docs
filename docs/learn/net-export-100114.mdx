Net exports are a measure of a nation's total trade. The formula for net exports is a simple one: The value of a nation's total export goods and services minus the value of all the goods and services it imports equals its net exports.A nation that has positive net exports enjoys a trade surplus, while negative net exports indicate that the nation hasÂ a trade deficit. A nation's net exports are thus a component of its overall balance of trade.
