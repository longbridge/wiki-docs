For example, if the current stock price is $50, the investor sets a stop price at $55 and a limit price at $56. When the stock price rises to $55, the stop-limit order is triggered, but the buy order will only execute if the price does not exceed $56.<br/>Sell Stop-Limit Order: An investor wants to sell a stock once its price falls below a certain level. For example, if the current stock price is $50, the investor sets a stop price at $45 and a limit price at $44. When the stock price drops to $45, the stop-limit order is triggered, but the sell order will only execute if the price is not below $44.<br/>By using stop-limit orders, investors can better control the transaction price while achieving their trading goals, reducing uncertainties caused by market volatility.</p>
