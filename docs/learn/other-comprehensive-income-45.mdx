Other comprehensive income refers to income or loss obtained by a company in areas other than its normal operating activities. These income or losses are not included in net profit and are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income. Some common types of other comprehensive income include foreign currency translation gains or losses, fair value changes of available-for-sale financial assets, and fair value changes of held-to-maturity investments.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other comprehensive income refers to the income or loss that a company earns from activities outside its normal business operations. These gains or losses are not included in net profit and are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income. Common examples include foreign currency translation gains and losses, changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, and changes in the fair value of held-to-maturity investments.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of other comprehensive income developed alongside the evolution of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Its purpose is to provide a more comprehensive reflection of a company's financial position and performance, especially as financial activities become more complex in a globalized context, where traditional net profit metrics are insufficient to fully capture a company's financial performance.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Other comprehensive income mainly includes the following categories: 1. Foreign currency translation gains and losses: Changes in the value of assets or liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations. 2. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets: Refers to market value changes of financial assets held for sale. 3. Effective portion of cash flow hedges: Value changes in financial instruments used to hedge future cash flow risks. The characteristics of other comprehensive income include its high volatility and the fact that it does not directly affect a company's net profit but does impact the total comprehensive income.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case 1: A multinational company disclosed in its annual financial report that due to its operations in multiple countries, foreign currency translation gains and losses significantly impacted its other comprehensive income. Due to exchange rate fluctuations, the company recorded substantial foreign currency translation losses in its other comprehensive income for a particular year. Case 2: An investment company holds a large amount of available-for-sale financial assets. During market fluctuations, the fair value of these assets changed significantly, leading the company to record substantial fair value changes in its other comprehensive income.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Investors often misunderstand the relationship between other comprehensive income and net profit, believing that other comprehensive income directly affects a company's profitability. In reality, other comprehensive income is a financial metric independent of net profit, primarily reflecting gains or losses from specific financial activities. Additionally, due to its high volatility, investors should consider its impact on the overall financial condition of the company when analyzing it.</p>`} id={45} />
