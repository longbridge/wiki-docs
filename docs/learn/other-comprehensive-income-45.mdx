Other comprehensive income refers to income or loss obtained by a company in areas other than its normal operating activities. These income or losses are not included in net profit and are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income. Some common types of other comprehensive income include foreign currency translation gains or losses, fair value changes of available-for-sale financial assets, and fair value changes of held-to-maturity investments.

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) refers to the income or loss that a company earns outside of its normal operating activities. These gains or losses are not included in the net profit but are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income. Common examples of OCI include foreign currency exchange gains and losses, changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, and changes in the fair value of held-to-maturity investments.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of OCI originated from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to provide a more comprehensive view of a company's financial performance and position. As globalization and financial markets became more complex, the need for a broader financial reporting framework led to the development of OCI.</p><h2>Categories and Characteristics</h2><p>OCI can be categorized into the following types:</p><ul><li><strong>Foreign Currency Exchange Gains and Losses:</strong> Changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations.</li><li><strong>Changes in the Fair Value of Available-for-Sale Financial Assets:</strong> Market value changes of available-for-sale financial assets.</li><li><strong>Changes in the Fair Value of Held-to-Maturity Investments:</strong> Market value changes of held-to-maturity investments.</li></ul><p>The characteristic of these gains or losses is that they do not directly affect the net profit but impact the comprehensive income, thereby affecting shareholders' equity.</p><h2>Specific Cases</h2><p><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company holds a foreign currency debt, and due to exchange rate fluctuations, the value of this debt in the local currency changes. This gain or loss is not included in the net profit but is recorded in OCI.</p><p><strong>Case 2:</strong> A company holds available-for-sale financial assets, and during the reporting period, the market value of these assets increases. This appreciation is not included in the net profit but is recorded in OCI.</p><h2>Common Questions</h2><p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why is OCI not included in the net profit?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> OCI reflects gains or losses from activities outside the normal business operations, which can be highly volatile. Including them in the net profit could lead to significant fluctuations in net profit, affecting the stability of financial statements.</p><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Does OCI affect a company's financial position?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, it does. Although OCI is not included in the net profit, it impacts the comprehensive income, thereby affecting shareholders' equity and the overall financial position of the company.</p>`} id={45} />
