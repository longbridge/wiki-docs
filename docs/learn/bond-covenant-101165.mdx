<p>Bond Covenant refers to the legal agreements or clauses between the bond issuer and the bondholders. These clauses are designed to protect the interests of the bondholders by ensuring that the issuer makes timely payments of interest and principal. Bond covenants typically include a series of restrictive clauses and commitments, such as limiting the issuer's ability to incur additional debt, requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios, restricting the sale of assets, and specifying default terms under certain conditions. If the issuer breaches these covenant terms, the bondholders may have the right to demand immediate repayment of the entire debt or take other legal actions.</p>
