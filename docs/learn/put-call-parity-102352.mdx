The term "put-call" parity refers to aÂ principle that defines the relationship between the price of European put and call options of the same class. Put simply, this concept highlights the consistencies of these same classes. Put and call options must have the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration date in order to be in the same class. The put-call parity, which only applies to European options, can be determined by a set equation.
