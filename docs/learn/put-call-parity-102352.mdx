The term "put-call" parity refers to a principle that defines the relationship between the price of European put and call options of the same class. Put simply, this concept highlights the consistencies of these same classes. Put and call options must have the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration date in order to be in the same class. The put-call parity, which only applies to European options, can be determined by a set equation.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Put-Call Parity is a principle that defines the price relationship between European put and call options of the same class. Simply put, this concept highlights the consistency of these same-class options. Put and call options must have the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration date to belong to the same class. Put-Call Parity, which only applies to European options, can be determined through a fixed equation.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of Put-Call Parity was first introduced by financial economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973. While researching option pricing models, they discovered this relationship between put and call options and described it through a mathematical formula.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Put-Call Parity mainly applies to European options, which can only be exercised on the expiration date. Its core characteristic is describing the price relationship between put and call options through a fixed equation. The equation is:<br/> <code>C - P = S - K * e^(-rT)</code><br/>where <code>C</code> represents the call option price, <code>P</code> represents the put option price, <code>S</code> represents the current price of the underlying asset, <code>K</code> represents the strike price, <code>r</code> represents the risk-free interest rate, and <code>T</code> represents the time to expiration.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><br/>Case 1: Suppose a stock's current price is $100, the strike price is $100, the risk-free interest rate is 5%, and the time to expiration is 1 year. According to the Put-Call Parity formula, if the call option price is $10, then the put option price should be:<br/> <code>P = C - S + K * e^(-rT) = 10 - 100 + 100 * e^(-0.05*1) ≈ 10 - 100 + 95.12 = 5.12</code><br/>Case 2: Suppose a stock's current price is $150, the strike price is $150, the risk-free interest rate is 3%, and the time to expiration is half a year. According to the Put-Call Parity formula, if the put option price is $8, then the call option price should be:<br/> <code>C = P + S - K * e^(-rT) = 8 + 150 - 150 * e^(-0.03*0.5) ≈ 8 + 150 - 147.77 = 10.23</code></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><br/>1. <strong>Does Put-Call Parity apply to American options?</strong><br/>No, it does not. The Put-Call Parity principle only applies to European options because American options can be exercised at any time before expiration, which affects their price relationship.<br/>2. <strong>What happens if the market does not satisfy the Put-Call Parity relationship?</strong><br/>If the market does not satisfy the Put-Call Parity relationship, arbitrage opportunities will arise. Investors can profit by buying the undervalued option and selling the overvalued option until prices return to equilibrium.</p>`} id={102352} />
