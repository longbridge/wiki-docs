<p>The days sales of inventory (DSI) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time in days that a company takes to turn its inventory, including goods that are a work in progress, into sales.&nbsp;</p><p>DSI is also known as the average age of inventory, days inventory outstanding (DIO), days in inventory (DII), days sales inventory, or days inventory and is interpreted in multiple ways. Indicating the liquidity of the inventory, the figure represents how many days a companyâ€™s current stock of inventory will last. Generally, a lower DSI is preferred as it indicates a shorter duration to clear off the inventory, though the average DSI varies from one industry to another.</p>
