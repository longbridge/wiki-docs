Secondary public offering refers to the behavior of already listed companies raising funds from the public through public offering. In the secondary public offering, the company raises funds from the public by issuing new shares to meet its capital needs. Secondary public offerings usually involve approval and supervision by securities exchanges to ensure the rights of public investors and the normal operation of the market.
