The exchange ratio is the relative number of new shares that will be given to existing shareholders of a company that has been acquired or that has merged with another. After the old company shares have been delivered, the exchange ratio is used to give shareholders the same relative value in new shares of the merged entity.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The exchange ratio refers to the ratio at which existing shareholders exchange their shares in the old company for shares in the new company during a merger or acquisition. This ratio determines the number of shares shareholders will receive in the new company, ensuring that their holding value in the new company is equivalent to their holding value in the old company.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of the exchange ratio originated from the practices of mergers and acquisitions. As competition among enterprises intensified and the need for market consolidation increased, the exchange ratio became an important tool for measuring how shareholders' equity is distributed in the new company. In the mid-20th century, with the development of capital markets and the increase in merger activities, the application of the exchange ratio became more common.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> The exchange ratio can be divided into fixed exchange ratio and floating exchange ratio.<ul><li><strong>Fixed Exchange Ratio:</strong> A fixed ratio is determined at the time of the merger agreement and does not change with market price fluctuations. This method is straightforward but may result in shareholders' gains or losses due to market price changes.</li><li><strong>Floating Exchange Ratio:</strong> The ratio is adjusted according to market price changes to ensure that shareholders' holding value in the new company is equivalent to their holding value in the old company. This method is more flexible but more complex to calculate and operate.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> Company A acquires Company B with an exchange ratio of 1:2, meaning that for every 1 share of Company B, shareholders will receive 2 shares of Company A. If a shareholder holds 100 shares of Company B, they will receive 200 shares of Company A after the merger.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Company C and Company D decide to merge using a floating exchange ratio. Suppose at the time of the merger agreement, Company C's stock price is $50, and Company D's stock price is $25, with an initial exchange ratio of 1:2. If by the time the merger is completed, Company C's stock price rises to $60, and Company D's stock price rises to $30, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to 1:2.4 to ensure equivalent holding value for shareholders.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Question 1:</strong> How does the exchange ratio affect shareholders' equity?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> The exchange ratio directly determines the number and value of shares shareholders will hold in the new company. If the exchange ratio is set reasonably, shareholders' equity will be fairly reflected in the new company.</li><li><strong>Question 2:</strong> Which is better, a fixed exchange ratio or a floating exchange ratio?<br/><strong>Answer:</strong> It depends on the market environment and the specific circumstances of the company. A fixed exchange ratio is straightforward but may affect shareholders' interests due to market fluctuations; a floating exchange ratio is more flexible but complex to operate.</li></ul></p>`} id={100573} />
