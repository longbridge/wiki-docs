Rho is the rate at which the price of a derivative changes relative to a change in the risk-free rate of interest. Rho measures the sensitivity of an option or options portfolio to a change in interest rate. Rho may also refer to the aggregated risk exposure to interest rate changes that exist for a book of several options positions.For example, if an option or options portfolio has a rho of 1.0, then for every 1 percentage-point increase in interest rates, the value of the option (or portfolio) increases 1 percent. Options that are most sensitive to changes in interest rates are those that are at-the-money and with the longest time to expiration.In mathematical finance, quantities that measure the price sensitivity of a derivative to a change in an underlying parameter are known as the "Greeks." The Greeks are important tools in risk management because they allow a manager, trader, or investor to measure the change in value of an investment or portfolio to a small change in a parameter. More important, this measurement allows the risk to be isolated, thus allowing a manager, trader, or investor to rebalance the portfolio to achieve a desired level of risk relative to that parameter. The most common Greeks are delta, gamma, vega, theta, and rho.
