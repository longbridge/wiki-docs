The term joint probability refers to a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time. Put simply, a joint probability is the probability of event Y occurring at the same time that event X occurs. In order for joint probability to work, both events must be independent of one another, which means they aren't conditional or don't rely on each other. Joint probabilities can be visualized using Venn diagrams.
