<p>Leaseback is a financial transaction arrangement where a company or individual sells an asset, typically real estate or equipment, to another party and then leases it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to obtain cash flow while continuing to use the asset. Leaseback is often used to improve a company's liquidity, pay off debt, or make other investments. Although the seller loses ownership of the asset, they can continue to use it through the lease agreement.</p>
