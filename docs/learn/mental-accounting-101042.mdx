Mental accounting refers to the different values a person places on the same amount of money, based on subjective criteria, often with detrimental results. Mental accounting is a concept in the field of behavioral economics. Developed by economist Richard H. Thaler, it contends that individuals classify funds differently and therefore are prone to irrational decision-making in their spending and investment behavior.
