<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Price stickiness refers to the phenomenon where market prices resist changes despite shifts in the overall economic environment that suggest an optimal price should be different. 'Stickiness' is a broad economic term that can apply to any financial variable that shows resistance to change. When applied to prices, it means that sellers (or buyers) of certain goods are unwilling to change prices even when input costs or demand patterns have changed.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of price stickiness can be traced back to Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes first introduced the theory of price and wage stickiness in his 1936 book, 'The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,' explaining why markets cannot quickly reach equilibrium.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> Price stickiness can be divided into upward stickiness and downward stickiness. Upward stickiness refers to the difficulty in raising prices, while downward stickiness refers to the difficulty in lowering prices. Characteristics of price stickiness include: 1. Adjustment costs: Changing prices incurs costs, such as repricing and re-tagging. 2. Contracts and agreements: Long-term contracts and agreements may limit price adjustments. 3. Information asymmetry: Information asymmetry between sellers and buyers may lead to delayed price adjustments.</p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong> 1. A once-popular smartphone remains priced at $800 even though demand has significantly dropped. 2. Restaurant menu prices are not frequently adjusted even if ingredient costs change, as reprinting menus and adjusting prices incur additional costs.</p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong> 1. Why does price stickiness occur? Price stickiness usually occurs due to adjustment costs, contracts and agreements, and information asymmetry. 2. What is the impact of price stickiness on the economy? Price stickiness can prevent markets from quickly reaching equilibrium, affecting the efficient allocation of resources.</p>`} id={101450} />
