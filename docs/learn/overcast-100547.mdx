An overcast is a type of forecasting error that occurs when an estimated metric, such as future cash flows, performance levels, or production, is forecast too high. Overcasting thus is when the estimated value turns out to be above the realized or actual value.Overcasting can be contrasted with undercasting, which is when a forecast is made too low.
