The debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) measures a firm's available cash flow to pay current debt obligations. The DSCR shows investors and lenders whether a company has enough income to pay its debts. The ratio is calculated by dividing net operating income by debt service, including principal and interest.

<AIContent content={`<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is a measure of a company's cash flow available to pay its current debt obligations. It shows investors and creditors whether a company has enough income to repay its debt. The ratio is calculated by dividing net operating income by debt service (including principal and interest).</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The concept of DSCR originated in the field of financial analysis, initially used to assess the financial health of companies. As the importance of corporate financing and debt management increased, DSCR became a key indicator for evaluating a company's debt repayment ability.</p><p><strong>Categories and Characteristics:</strong> DSCR can be categorized as follows:<ul><li><strong>High DSCR:</strong> Typically greater than 1, indicating that the company has sufficient net operating income to cover its debt service, suggesting a healthy financial status.</li><li><strong>Low DSCR:</strong> Typically less than 1, indicating that the company may not be able to fully cover its debt service, suggesting financial risk.</li></ul>Characteristics:<ul><li>Simple and easy to understand: Can be calculated using a straightforward formula.</li><li>Highly intuitive: Directly reflects the company's debt repayment ability.</li><li>Widely applicable: Suitable for various types of companies and project financing.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Specific Cases:</strong><ul><li><strong>Case 1:</strong> A company has an annual net operating income of 5 million yuan and annual debt service (including principal and interest) of 4 million yuan, resulting in a DSCR of 500/400=1.25. This means the company has enough income to cover its debt and has a surplus.</li><li><strong>Case 2:</strong> Another company has an annual net operating income of 3 million yuan and annual debt service of 3.5 million yuan, resulting in a DSCR of 300/350=0.86. This indicates that the company does not have enough income to cover its debt, suggesting a higher financial risk.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Common Questions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Does a DSCR below 1 mean the company will definitely default?</strong> Not necessarily. While a DSCR below 1 indicates insufficient income to cover debt, the company may have other means (such as asset sales or additional financing) to meet its debt obligations.</li><li><strong>How can a company improve its DSCR?</strong> A company can improve its DSCR by increasing net operating income or reducing debt service (e.g., refinancing to lower interest expenses).</li></ul></p>`} id={102498} />
