A variable ratio write is a strategy in options investing that requires holding a long position in the underlying asset while simultaneously writing multiple call options at varying strike prices. It is essentially a ratio buy-write strategy.The trader's goal is to capture the premiums paid for the call options. Variable ratio writes have limited profit potential. The strategy is best used on stocks with little expected volatility, particularly in the near term.
