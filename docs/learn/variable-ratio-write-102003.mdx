Essentially, it is a ratio buy-write strategy. The trader's goal is to earn premiums from the call options. The profit potential of variable ratio writing is limited. This strategy is best suited for stocks expected to have low volatility, especially in the short term.</p><p><strong>Origin:</strong> The variable ratio writing strategy originated with the development of the options market, particularly after the establishment of options exchanges in the 1970s.

The investor writes three call options with strike prices of $110, $120, and $130. If the stock price does not exceed $110 at expiration, the investor will earn premiums from all three options.
