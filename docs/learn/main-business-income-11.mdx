<p>Main business income refers to the income obtained by a company through its main business. Main business income is the main source of a company's operating activities and can reflect the company's market competitiveness and operating conditions and operational status.</p>

<AIContent content={`<h2>Definition</h2><p>Main business revenue refers to the income that a company earns from its primary business activities. It is the main source of a company's operating activities and reflects the company's market competitiveness and operational status. It is an important indicator for measuring a company's business performance.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The concept of main business revenue became clearer with the development of modern corporate systems. In the early 20th century, as companies expanded and diversified their operations, there was a need to distinguish core business income from other revenue sources to better assess core competitiveness and market performance.</p><h2>Categories and Features</h2><p>Main business revenue can be categorized based on the industry and specific business type of a company. For example, in manufacturing, main business revenue typically comes from product sales, while in the service industry, it may come from service provision. Its features include stability, predictability, and a close connection to the company's core competitiveness. The advantage of main business revenue is that it provides information on the company's core profitability, but the disadvantage is that it may overlook other important revenue sources.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>For example, Apple's main business revenue primarily comes from iPhone sales, reflecting its strong competitiveness in the smartphone market. Another example is Starbucks, whose main business revenue mainly comes from coffee beverage sales, demonstrating its brand influence and market share in the global coffee market.</p><h2>Common Issues</h2><p>Common issues investors face when analyzing main business revenue include distinguishing it from other income and assessing its impact on the company's overall financial health. A common misconception is that higher main business revenue is always better, overlooking the importance of profit margins and cost control.</p>`} id={11} />
