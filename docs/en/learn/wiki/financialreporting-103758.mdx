Financial report is a report prepared by a company reflecting its financial status, operating results, and cash flow status. Financial reports include balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in owner's equity, etc. Financial reports are the main channel for companies to provide information to external stakeholders such as investors and creditors, and they are also an important basis for regulatory agencies to supervise and evaluate a company's financial status.
