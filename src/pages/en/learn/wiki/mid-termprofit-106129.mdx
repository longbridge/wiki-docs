Mid-term profit refers to the profit obtained by an enterprise or individual after deducting expenses from income during a certain period of time (usually 1 to 3 years). Compared with short-term and long-term profits, mid-term profit can better reflect the operating status and future development trend of enterprises or individuals, and therefore has important significance in investment decisions.
