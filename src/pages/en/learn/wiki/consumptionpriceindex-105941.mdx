The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an indicator that measures the price changes of a basket of goods and services purchased by households during a certain period of time. CPI is often used to measure the level and impact of inflation. The calculation method of CPI includes selecting a certain quantity and type of representative goods and services, and then calculating the index based on the price changes of these goods and services. The changes in CPI reflect the price changes of goods and services, thereby affecting the purchasing power and cost of living for households.
