Underwriting public offerings refers to the purchase of stocks or bonds of unlisted companies by underwriters or underwriting syndicates, who are responsible for selling them to investors. In underwriting public offerings, underwriters or underwriting syndicates usually sign underwriting agreements with the issuing company, specifying the purchase and sale price and quantity. After purchasing stocks or bonds, underwriters or underwriting syndicates will sell them to investors through a series of sales activities to help the company raise funds and promote the listing and trading of stocks or bonds. Underwriting public offerings usually require approval from securities regulatory authorities and may involve certain risks and costs.
