The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks in the United States lend to each other. It is a tool used by the Federal Reserve System to influence short-term interest rates by adjusting the money supply. Changes in the federal funds rate can have an impact on the entire US economy, as it can affect other rates, such as loan rates, deposit rates, and mortgage rates.
