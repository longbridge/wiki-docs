Aftermarket trading refers to trading activities that take place after the exchange's normal business hours. In the US stock market, normal business hours are from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm every Monday to Friday. Trading activities after this time period are referred to as aftermarket trading or extended trading. Participants in aftermarket trading are usually institutional investors and individual investors. Unlike normal trading, aftermarket trading has lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations.
