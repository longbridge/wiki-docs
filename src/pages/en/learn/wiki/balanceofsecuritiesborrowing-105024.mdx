Short selling balance refers to the number of margin-traded stocks that investors have not yet sold in short selling transactions. Short selling refers to the practice of borrowing stocks from a broker, selling them, and then buying them back at a lower price to return them to the broker, thereby profiting from the difference. Short selling balance reflects the number of stocks that investors can currently use for margin trading.
