Final case information refers to a legal case in which all appeals and litigation procedures have concluded, and no further appeals or other litigation procedures can be conducted. After the determination of final case information, the court's judgment or ruling has legal effect, and the parties cannot file new appeals or litigation requests regarding the case.
