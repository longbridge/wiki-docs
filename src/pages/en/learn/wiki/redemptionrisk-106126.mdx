Gating risk refers to the risk that investors cannot withdraw funds from investment products due to specific reasons. This risk may be caused by insufficient liquidity of the investment product, market volatility, or other unpredictable factors. Gating risk may cause investors to be unable to withdraw funds in a timely manner, resulting in investment losses. Investors should pay attention to gating risk when choosing investment products and evaluate their own capital needs and risk tolerance.
