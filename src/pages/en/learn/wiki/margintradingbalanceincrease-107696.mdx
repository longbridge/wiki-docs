An increase in the margin trading balance refers to the situation where the borrowed securities in the margin trading account increase after the investor borrows securities for sale in margin trading. Margin trading refers to the practice of investors borrowing stocks from a brokerage firm and then selling the borrowed stocks in the hope of repurchasing them at a lower price to profit from the price difference. An increase in the margin trading balance indicates that the number of securities borrowed by the investor in margin trading has increased, which may mean that the investor has increased the scale of margin trading or engaged in new margin trading transactions.
