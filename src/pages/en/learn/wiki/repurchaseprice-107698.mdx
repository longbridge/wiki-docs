The repurchase price refers to the price paid by a company or institution to the holders when repurchasing its issued bonds or stocks. The repurchase price is usually higher than the market price of the bonds or stocks to encourage holders to sell them to the company or institution. The repurchase price can also be used to evaluate the repurchase yield of bonds or stocks.
