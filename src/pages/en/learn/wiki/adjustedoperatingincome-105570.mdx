Adjusted operating profit refers to a company's operating profit after deducting some non-recurring items. These non-recurring items may be income or expenses that do not belong to the company's normal business activities. Adjusted operating profit can be used to evaluate a company's operating performance, as it reflects the true profit of the company's normal operating activities.
