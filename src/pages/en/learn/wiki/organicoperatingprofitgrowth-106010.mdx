Organic operating profit growth refers to the increase in operating profit achieved by a company through internal measures such as improving production efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing sales, without any external factors such as acquisitions or mergers. This indicator reflects the improvement of a company's internal operating capabilities and is also one of the important indicators for investors to evaluate the company's financial condition and investment value.
