A sponsoring institution refers to an institution that serves as a sponsor in the process of a company's listing or securities issuance. Its main responsibilities include assisting the company in preparing for listing or securities issuance, providing consultation and advice, preparing and reviewing sponsoring documents, and being responsible for market promotion and sales during the issuance process. Sponsoring institutions need to have certain financial strength and professional capabilities, and comply with relevant laws, regulations, and rules of securities exchanges.
