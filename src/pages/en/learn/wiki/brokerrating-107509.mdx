Brokerage rating refers to the act of evaluating and judging the investment value of a stock or bond by a securities company. Brokerage ratings are usually based on factors such as the company's financial condition, business prospects, and industry competition to assess the investment risk and return potential of the stock or bond. Ratings are typically divided into buy, hold, and sell levels, and are used to guide investors in making decisions when buying and selling stocks and bonds. Brokerage rating is one of the important indicators that investors refer to.
