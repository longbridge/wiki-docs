Weighted stocks refer to individual stocks with a higher proportion in the stock index, with a larger market value and a greater impact on the overall trend and volatility of the index. In general, the rise and fall of weighted stocks will have a significant impact on the entire stock index, and investors need to closely monitor the performance of weighted stocks and their impact on the index.
