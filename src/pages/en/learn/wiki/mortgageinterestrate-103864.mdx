Mortgage loan interest rate refers to the rate charged by a bank when a homebuyer borrows money from the bank to purchase a house. Mortgage loan interest rates are usually determined based on factors such as the borrower's credit rating, the value of the house, the loan term, and market interest rates. A lower mortgage loan interest rate may mean lower monthly payments and less interest, but it also requires higher credit requirements and a higher down payment.
