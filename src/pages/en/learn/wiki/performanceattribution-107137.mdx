Performance attribution refers to the analysis of the performance of a portfolio or asset to determine the contribution of different factors to the performance. Performance attribution can provide an understanding of the performance of a portfolio or asset in different market environments and determine which factors have the greatest impact on performance. Common performance attribution methods include attribution to industry, attribution to style, attribution to trading, and attribution to stock selection. Performance attribution can help investors evaluate the effectiveness of investment strategies and guide investment decisions.
