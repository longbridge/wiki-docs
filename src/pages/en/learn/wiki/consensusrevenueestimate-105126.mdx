Consensus revenue forecast refers to the forecast of financial professionals reaching a consensus on a company's revenue situation for a period of time in the future. These professionals analyze the company's financial statements, industry trends, market environment, and other information to estimate the company's future revenue. Consensus revenue forecasts can provide market participants with a common understanding of the company's future business performance, and have a certain guiding role in investment decisions and market expectations.
