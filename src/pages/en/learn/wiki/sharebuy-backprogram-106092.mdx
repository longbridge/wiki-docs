Share buyback plan refers to the act of a listed company using its own funds to repurchase its issued shares. The company's repurchase of its own shares can increase earnings per share, stabilize stock prices, improve financial conditions and increase shareholder value. Share buyback plans are usually taken by companies when they believe their stocks are undervalued.
