Secondary offering refers to the act of publicly issuing stocks or other securities that have already been issued in the securities market. Secondary offerings are usually conducted by listed companies to increase their capital or raise funds for specific projects or development plans. Secondary offerings often have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders because the newly issued stocks increase the supply in the market.
