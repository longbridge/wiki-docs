Credit loss provision is the funds set aside by banks or financial institutions to deal with potential credit losses. Credit losses refer to borrowers' inability to repay debts on time or according to the terms of the contract, resulting in economic losses for the creditors. Credit loss provisions are usually made at a certain percentage to ensure that financial institutions have enough funds to cover potential credit losses. Making provisions for credit losses can help financial institutions maintain a healthy financial condition when facing bad debt risks.
