Equity structure refers to the distribution of equity among the owners of a company. It reflects the ownership and control rights of the owners over the company. The equity structure includes the proportion of shares held by shareholders, as well as their voting rights and decision-making powers. The equity structure has a significant impact on the governance and development of a company, and it is also one of the important indicators for investors to assess the value and risk of a company.
