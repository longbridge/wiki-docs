Return on tangible equity refers to the ratio of a company's profit to its tangible net assets. Tangible net assets refer to net assets deducted by intangible assets (such as goodwill) and long-term equity investments. Return on tangible equity can measure the return on profit relative to tangible net assets of a company, and is an important indicator for evaluating the profitability and capital operation efficiency of a company.
