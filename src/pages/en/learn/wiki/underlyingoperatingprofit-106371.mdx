Basic operating profit refers to the operating profit of a company after deducting non-recurring items. Non-recurring items include one-time income, one-time expenses, and other items unrelated to the normal operation of the company. Basic operating profit can better reflect the operating condition of the company by excluding the impact of non-recurring factors on profit, and more accurately evaluate the company's profitability and operational efficiency.
