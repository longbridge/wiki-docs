EPS guidance is a forecast of future earnings per share issued by a company. It is usually based on the company's financial data and industry trends, and is one of the important indicators for investors to evaluate the company's profitability and future performance. However, EPS guidance is not a guarantee of the company's future performance, as it is influenced by various factors such as market fluctuations, changes in the economic environment, etc.
