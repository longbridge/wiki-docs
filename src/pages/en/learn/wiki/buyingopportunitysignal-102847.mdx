Buy-low signal refers to the situation in the stock market where investors consider it a good opportunity to buy when stock prices fall to a relatively low level. Buy-low signal means that the stock price has approached the bottom and is expected to rebound and rise. Investors can buy stocks at a lower price to gain future returns.
