Release of pledge refers to the process in which a debtor, after repaying a debt, pays the corresponding release of pledge payment to the creditor, so that the pledged property is released from pledge status and returned to the debtor. The release of pledge is usually carried out after the debtor has fully repaid the debt in accordance with the contractual agreement.
