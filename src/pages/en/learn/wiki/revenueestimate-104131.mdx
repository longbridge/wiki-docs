Estimated operating revenue refers to the forecast and estimation of the operating revenue that a company may achieve in a future period. The analysis of estimated operating revenue is usually based on factors such as market demand, industry trends, and competitive environment, and takes into account the company's own sales capabilities and market share. Estimated operating revenue is an important indicator for investors and analysts to evaluate a company's profitability and development potential.
