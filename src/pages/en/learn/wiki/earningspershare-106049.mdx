Earnings per share (EPS) refers to the ratio of a company's net profit to the number of ordinary shares. It is one of the important indicators for measuring a company's profitability. The higher the EPS, the more profit each share of the company's stock creates, and investors can have the potential to receive more dividends or see an increase in stock price.
