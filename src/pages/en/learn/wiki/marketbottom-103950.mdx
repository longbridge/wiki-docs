Market bottom refers to the lowest point of a stock price over a period of time. In technical analysis, market bottom is often seen as a support level for stock prices, meaning that when the price falls to this level, investors will start buying stocks and push up the stock price. Judging market bottoms is very important for investors, as it can help them find opportunities to buy low and sell high.
