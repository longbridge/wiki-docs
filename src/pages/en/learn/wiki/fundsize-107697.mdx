Fund size refers to the total size of the fund assets managed by the fund manager. It is an important indicator for measuring the size of a fund and is usually measured in billions of yuan. The size of the fund is related to the fund's investment capability and market influence. A larger fund size usually means more funds available for investment, but it may also lead to restrictions on investment opportunities and risks of market manipulation.
