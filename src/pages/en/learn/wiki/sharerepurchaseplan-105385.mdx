A share repurchase program refers to the specific plan for a listed company to repurchase its own shares. Share repurchases can increase the concentration of ownership, increase earnings per share, and boost market confidence, among other benefits. The share repurchase program needs to specify the quantity, price, and duration of the repurchases.
