Refining profit margin refers to the ratio of profit obtained by a refining company through the sale of refined petroleum products to the cost of processing crude oil during the refining process. Refining profit margin is an important indicator of refining companies, reflecting their profitability and operational efficiency. The higher the refining profit margin, the better the profitability of the refining company.
