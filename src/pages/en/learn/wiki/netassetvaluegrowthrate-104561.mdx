Net asset value growth rate refers to the growth rate of a fund's unit net asset value over a certain period of time, usually on an annual basis. It is one of the important indicators for measuring fund performance and reflects the fund's investment return rate. The higher the net asset value growth rate, the better the fund's performance.
