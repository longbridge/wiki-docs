Delisting risk warning refers to a warning signal that a stock may be delisted by the exchange. The exchange will monitor the stock, and if it is found to have delisting risk, a delisting risk warning will be issued. This is usually due to poor financial condition of the company, long-term trading price of the stock below a certain level, or other violations by the company. The issuance of delisting risk warning may have a negative impact on the stock price.
