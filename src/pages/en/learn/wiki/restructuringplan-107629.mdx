A restructuring plan refers to a series of strategies and actions taken by a company to change its organizational structure, business model, or financial condition. A restructuring plan typically includes measures such as corporate mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, asset sales or divestitures, and debt restructuring, with the aim of improving the company's competitiveness, increasing value, or addressing financial difficulties. The goal of a restructuring plan is to achieve the long-term sustainable development of the company by adjusting resource allocation, optimizing operational efficiency, and improving financial condition.
