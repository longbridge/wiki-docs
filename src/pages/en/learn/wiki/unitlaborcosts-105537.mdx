Unit labor cost refers to the ratio between the wages and benefits paid to laborers by a production unit within a certain period of time and the quantity of products created by the production unit. The level of unit labor cost can reflect the labor productivity and labor cost level of an economy. An increase in unit labor cost may lead to an increase in production costs for a company and affect its profitability.
