Passive income refers to income that individuals or companies obtain without actively working, through investments, rentals, franchise rights, and other means. It is in contrast to active income, such as wages and salaries, which require actual work or the provision of services to earn. Passive income can be achieved through investments in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets, as well as through leasing and franchising. Passive income typically has stability and sustainability, and can provide additional economic sources for individuals or companies.
