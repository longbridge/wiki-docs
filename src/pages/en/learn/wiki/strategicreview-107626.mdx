Strategic assessment is a process of examining the enterprise strategy, aiming to evaluate and optimize the strategic positioning and development direction of the enterprise. Strategic assessment usually includes analysis of the internal and external environment of the enterprise, as well as evaluation of competitors and market trends. Through strategic assessment, the enterprise can determine whether the current strategy is still applicable, whether adjustments or changes are needed to adapt to changing market conditions, and achieve long-term growth objectives.
