Producer price inflation refers to the increase in producer price index (PPI). The producer price index measures the cost changes of producers purchasing raw materials and production equipment, and is usually used as an indicator to predict the consumer price index (CPI). Producer price inflation may affect the costs and profits of businesses, and have an impact on economic activities.
