Stock unlocking refers to the process in which stocks of a listed company that were originally restricted from being sold can be freely traded after a specific time point. Stock unlocking usually occurs with stocks held by shareholders, executives, or employees of the listed company, and these stocks can be traded on the secondary market after unlocking. Stock unlocking may have an impact on stock prices and market supply and demand.
