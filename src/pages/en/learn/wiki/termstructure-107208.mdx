Interest rate term structure refers to the relationship between interest rates of different maturities. Typically, longer-term interest rates are higher than shorter-term interest rates, reflecting different market expectations for future economic conditions and inflation. Interest rate term structure can be used to assess market views on future economic conditions and for bond investment and interest rate risk management.
