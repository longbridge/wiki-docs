Dividend investment is an investment strategy that focuses on purchasing stocks with stable dividend payments and potential for growth. Dividend investors choose to purchase stocks of companies with stable profitability and good financial conditions in order to obtain dividend income. They believe that dividend income can provide stable cash flow and that the growth of dividends can increase investment returns. Dividend investment is often considered a relatively low-risk investment strategy and is suitable for investors seeking stable income.
