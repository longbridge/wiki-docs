Risk preference for funds refers to the degree to which individuals or institutions are willing to accept risk in investment decisions. Risk preference for funds is typically determined based on the degree of preference for expected returns and losses. High risk preference indicates that individuals or institutions are more willing to take higher risks in order to obtain higher returns, while low risk preference indicates that individuals or institutions are more inclined to choose lower risks to maintain the safety of funds. Risk preference for funds can be reflected through portfolio allocation and selection.
