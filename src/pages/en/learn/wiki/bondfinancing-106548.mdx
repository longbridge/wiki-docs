Bond financing refers to a method in which a company or institution raises funds by issuing bonds. Bonds are a type of debt instrument, and the issuer promises to pay interest and repay the principal to the bondholders within a certain period of time. Bond financing can help companies or institutions raise the necessary funds, while bondholders can earn fixed interest income by holding bonds. Bond financing is commonly used for expanding business operations, investing in projects, and repaying debts.
