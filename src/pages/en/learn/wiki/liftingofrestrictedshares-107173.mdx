Restricted stock lifting refers to a system in the stock market where shareholders are unable to sell their held stocks for a certain period of time. After this period ends, shareholders are free to sell their held stocks. The lifting of restrictions on stock sales usually has a certain impact on the stock market and may lead to fluctuations in stock prices.
