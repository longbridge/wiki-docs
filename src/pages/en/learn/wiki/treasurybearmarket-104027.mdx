The bear market of government bonds refers to the situation where long-term interest rates rise and bond prices fall in the government bond market.

The bear market of government bonds usually means that the market is optimistic about the economic growth and inflation expectations, and the demand for high-risk assets such as stocks increases, leading to a drop in government bond prices.
