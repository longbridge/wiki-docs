Cost structure refers to the composition and proportion of various costs in the production and operation process of a company. Cost structure can include direct costs (such as raw materials, labor costs), indirect costs (such as administrative expenses, sales expenses), as well as fixed costs and variable costs, etc. Understanding a company's cost structure can help analyze its profitability and operational efficiency.
