Net reduction refers to the net change in the number of shares held by shareholders or major shareholders within a certain period of time. Net reduction can be achieved through reductions in shareholding, transfer of shares, or other means. Net reduction is one of the important indicators to measure the confidence and attitude of shareholders or major shareholders towards the company. A significant net reduction may indicate uncertainty or pessimism about the future development of the company by shareholders or major shareholders.
