Exercise price refers to the price at which the underlying asset specified in an options contract can be bought or sold. For a call options contract, the exercise price is the price at which the underlying asset can be bought, while for a put options contract, the exercise price is the price at which the underlying asset can be sold. The exercise price is usually related to the expiration date of the options contract. Before the expiration date, investors holding options can choose whether to exercise the options to buy or sell the underlying asset. The choice of exercise price has a significant impact on the profitability and loss of the options, and investors will determine the exercise price based on market expectations and risk preferences.
