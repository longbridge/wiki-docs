Dot plot is a chart format used to display central bank officials' expectations for future interest rates or policies. In a dot plot, each central bank official marks the projected level of interest rates or policy changes and represents their confidence in this expectation through the size of the dot. Dot plots can provide market participants with predictions and expectations for the possible direction of central bank policies.
