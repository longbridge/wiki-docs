Contract sales amount refers to the amount of goods or services sold or provided by a company as agreed in the sales contract. This amount is determined based on the price terms and quantity in the contract, and is used to measure the company's sales scale and revenue. The contract sales amount usually includes the unit price, quantity, and total amount of the goods sold or services provided.
