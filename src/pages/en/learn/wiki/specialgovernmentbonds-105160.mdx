Special national debt refers to a type of government bond issued by the government to meet the needs of special periods. The issuance of special national debt is mainly to make up for the funding gap that the government needs to deal with in special periods, such as natural disasters, wars, etc. The yield of special national debt is generally higher, but the corresponding risk is also higher.
