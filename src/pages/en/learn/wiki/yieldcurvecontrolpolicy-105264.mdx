The yield curve control policy is a monetary policy tool aimed at influencing market interest rates and borrowing costs by adjusting the gap between short-term and long-term interest rates. This policy is usually implemented by the central bank to stabilize the economy, control inflation, and promote economic growth. The yield curve control policy can be implemented through the purchase or sale of government bonds such as treasury bonds.
