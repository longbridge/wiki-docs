Target price revision refers to the adjustment of the target price of a stock by financial professionals. The target price is the reasonable price of a stock predicted by analysts or institutions based on their analysis of the company's fundamentals, industry outlook, and market conditions for a certain period of time in the future. When analysts or institutions have new insights or expectations about the company's fundamentals, industry outlook, or market conditions, they may revise the target price. Target price revision is usually influenced by factors such as market sentiment, company performance, and industry changes.
