Inflation adjustment refers to the process of adjusting financial data or asset values according to inflation. Due to the existence of inflation, the purchasing power of money will decrease over time. In order to reflect the changes in real purchasing power, financial data and asset values need to be adjusted for inflation. Inflation adjustment can be achieved by multiplying values by the appropriate inflation rate or using an inflation index for calculation. Inflation adjustment can help people more accurately assess the value of assets or calculate the real purchasing power of income.
