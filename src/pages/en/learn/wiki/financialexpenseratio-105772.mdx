The financial expense ratio refers to the proportion of a company's financial expenses in its operating income, which is an important indicator for evaluating a company's level of financial costs. Financial expenses include interest expenses, exchange gains and losses, handling fees and commissions, bank fees, etc., which are expenses incurred by a company in financing and operating activities. The higher the financial expense ratio, the higher the company's financial costs, which has a negative impact on the company's profitability.
