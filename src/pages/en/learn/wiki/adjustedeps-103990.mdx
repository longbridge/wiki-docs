Adjusted earnings per share refers to the indicator obtained by adjusting the original earnings per share when calculating the earnings per share of a company. This adjustment typically includes the impact of some non-recurring items, such as restructuring costs, impairment losses, etc. Adjusted earnings per share can more accurately reflect the operating conditions and profitability of a company.
