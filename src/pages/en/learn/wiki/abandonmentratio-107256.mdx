The abandonment rate refers to the proportion of purchases of a certain product or service that are abandoned within a certain period of time. It can be used to measure consumer satisfaction or changes in demand for the product or service. A higher abandonment rate may indicate quality issues or a failure to meet consumer expectations, requiring improvement and adjustment.
