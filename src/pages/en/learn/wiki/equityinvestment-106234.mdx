Equity investment refers to the investment behavior of acquiring ownership of a company through purchasing company stocks or becoming a company partner. Equity investment has relatively high risks and returns, and investors usually need to take on higher risks and conduct more in-depth research and analysis on their investments. The returns on equity investment may come from factors such as dividends, stock price increases, or improvements in company performance.
