A share buyback plan refers to the act of a listed company or other institution reducing the total amount of company shares by purchasing its own issued shares. Share buyback plans can be conducted through market trading or private agreements. This behavior is usually done to improve shareholder equity, increase shareholder value or improve the company's financial situation.
