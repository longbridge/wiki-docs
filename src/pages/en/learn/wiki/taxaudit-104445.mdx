Tax audit refers to the regulatory activity of tax authorities to verify and review the tax declaration and payment of taxpayers. Tax audits aim to discover and investigate illegal activities of taxpayers, ensure that taxpayers fulfill their tax obligations in accordance with the law, and maintain tax order and fairness. Tax audits can be conducted through methods such as inspecting financial data such as account books and invoices, conducting on-site inspections, and investigating and collecting evidence.
