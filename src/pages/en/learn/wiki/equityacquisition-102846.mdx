Equity acquisition refers to the acquisition of control over the target company or a certain proportion of equity in the target company through the purchase of equity. Equity acquisition can be friendly, meaning that the target company and the acquirer reach a consensus and complete the transaction; it can also be hostile, meaning that the acquirer purchases equity directly from shareholders without the consent of the target company.
