Inflation expectations refer to people's expectations of future inflation rates. The inflation rate refers to the annual change rate of the price level, and a high inflation rate means a decrease in the value of money and a weakening of purchasing power. Inflation expectations can affect the volatility of asset prices in currency markets, stock markets, bond markets, and other markets.
