Form 10-Q is a report form required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for publicly listed companies to submit quarterly. This report provides detailed information about the company's financial condition, business operations, and risk factors, including financial statements, profitability, cash flow, significant events, and risks. The submission of Form 10-Q requires companies to timely disclose the latest situation of the enterprise to investors and regulatory agencies, so that investors can better understand the company's operating status and risks.
