Adjusted EBITDA refers to the value obtained by adjusting the factors such as interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization in the profit when calculating the profit of a company. This indicator can be used to evaluate the operating status and profitability of a company, as it eliminates the impact of some non-operating factors on profits.
