Semi-annual equity distribution refers to the act of listed companies distributing profits to shareholders based on their semi-annual performance. Specifically, listed companies will determine the amount and proportion of profit distribution based on the size of their semi-annual net profit. This is a return from listed companies to shareholders and a form of income obtained by shareholders holding stocks.
